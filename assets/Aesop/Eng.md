1. The Wolf and the Lamb

WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, 
resolved not to lay violent hands on him,
but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf’s right to eat him. 
He thus addressed him
 “Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.”
“Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, 
“I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf, “You feed in my pasture.” 
“No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted grass.”
 Again said the Wolf,
“You drink of my well.” 
 “No,” exclaimed the Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both food and drink to me.” 

Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, “Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.”
The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

2. The Bat and the Weasels

A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared his life.
The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds.
The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. 
Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him.
The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. 
The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.
It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.

​3. The Ass and the Grasshopper

AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices.
They replied, “The dew.”
The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger.

4. The Lion and the Mouse​

A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face.
Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying:
“If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.”
The Lion laughed and let him go.
It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters,
who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. 

The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaim
“You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on a Lion.”

5. The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller

A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened. The Fuller replied, “The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again with your charcoal.”
Like will draw like.

6. The Father and His Sons

A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces.

They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.”


7. The Boy Hunting Locusts

A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to take him. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: If you had but touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!”

8. The Cock and the Jewel
​
A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious stone and exclaimed: “If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.”

9. The Kingdom of the Lion
​

THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, “Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong.” And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.

10. The Wolf and the Crane

A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: “Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.”
In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.


11. The Fisherman Piping
​
A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said: “O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.”

12. Hercules and the Wagoner
​
A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed him: “Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.”
Self-help is the best help.

13. The Ants and the Grasshopper
​

THE ANTS were spending a fine winter’s day drying grain collected in the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, “Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?’ He replied, “I had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.” They then said in derision: “If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.”

14. The Traveler and His Dog
​
A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: “Why do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.” The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: “O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.”
The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.
​
15. The Dog and the Shadow
​

A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.

16. The Mole and His Mother
​
A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: “I am sure than I can see, Mother!” In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, “What is it?’ The young Mole said, “It is a pebble.” His Mother exclaimed: “My son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.

17. The Herdsman and the Lost Bull
​

A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said: “Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own escape from him in safety.”

18. The Hare and the Tortoise

A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, who replied, laughing: “Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race.” The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course.
​
The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.
Slow but steady wins the race.

19. The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble

THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most beautiful. When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the neighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone: “Pray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease from such vain disputings.”

20. The Farmer and the Stork

A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. “Pray save me, Master,” he said, “and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers — they are not the least like those of a Crane.”
​
The Farmer laughed aloud and said, “It may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.”
Birds of a feather flock together.


21. The Farmer and the Snake

ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. “Oh,” cried the Farmer with his last breath, “I am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.”
The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.

22. The Fawn and His Mother

A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, “You are larger than a dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?” She smiled, and said: “I know full well, my son, that all you say is true. I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can.”
No arguments will give courage to the coward.

23. 곰과 여우


23. The Bear and the Fox
23. 곰과 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear, “Oh! that you would eat the dead and not the living.”
곰이, 자신은 박애(남들을 평등하게 사랑함)정신이 많다면 엄청 뽐내고 있었어요.
그러니까 곰의 말로는, 자신이 사람으로 치면 남들을 잘 배려해주고 사랑하는 그런 동물이라는 거지요.
“난 죽은 것엔 손 하나 까딱하지 않거든.”
그러자 보다 못한 여우가 비씩 웃으며 곰에게 말했어요.
“오! 산 걸 먹지 말고 죽은 것만 먹는 게 더 좋은 거 아냐.”

​

THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. The Crow put an end to the dispute by saying, “Your feathers are all very well in the spring, but mine protect me against the winter.”
Fair weather friends are not worth much.
제비와 까마귀가 서로 자기들 깃털이 예쁘다고 말싸움을 벌이고 있었어요.
마침내 까마귀가 다음과 같이 말함으로써 논쟁에 끝을 맺었답니다.
“봄엔 네 깃털이 아주 그럴 듯해 보이겠지만, 사실 겨울철 추위를 막아주기엔 내 깃털만한 게 없단다.”

25. 애만 쓰고 보람이 없는 일 (이솝 우화)
​

A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises were heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the matter. While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible calamity, out came a Mouse.
Don’t make much ado about nothing.
한번은 산이 심하게 흔들리더니, 큰 굉음과 소음들이 들려왔어요.
깜짝 놀란 사람들이 무슨 일이 벌어진 건지 보려고 나왔죠.

26. 당나귀와 여우와 사자


26. The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion
26. 당나귀와 여우와 사자 (이솝 우화)
​

THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox. Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his leisure.
당나귀와 여우가 서로를 보호해주기로 하는 파트너십(동반자관계)을 맺고는, 숲으로 사냥을 하러 들어갔답니다.
그들은 멀리 가지 않아 사자와 맞닥뜨리고 말았죠.
상황이 너무도 긴박했기에 여우가 살며시 사자에게 다가가더니 “저를 해치시지만 않겠다면 당나귀를 속여 사로잡히게 도와드리겠습니다.”라고 약속했어요.
그런 다음 여우는 당나귀에게 다시 와선 “절대 위험한 일은 없을 거야, 나만 믿어.”라며 안심시키고는 당나귀를 깊은 구덩이로 데리고 가 빠지게 했어요.
당나귀가 잡힌 것을 본 사자는 즉시 그 여우를 잡아먹고는 나중에 시간이 났을 때 그 당나귀마저도 잡아먹어버렸답니다.

27. 거북과 독수리


27. The Tortoise and the Eagle
27. 거북과 독수리 (이솝 우화)
​

A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air. “I will give you,” she said, “all the riches of the Red Sea.” “I will teach you to fly then,” said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: “I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?’
If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.
하루는 거북이 태양 볕을 받으며 일광욕을 하며 바닷새들에게 거북 자신의 억센 운명을 한탄하고 있었어요.
“누구도 내게 나는 법을 가르쳐주지 않았어.”
때마침 근처를 빙빙 돌고 있던 독수리가 거북이 한탄하는 그 소리를 듣고서 말했어요.
“내가 너를 높이 들어 올려 날 수 있게 공중에다 놓아주면 넌 내게 무얼 해줄래?”
“뭐든 다 해줄게,”라며 거북이 말했어요. “바다에서 나는 건 다 해줄게.”
“그럼 내가 나는 법을 가르쳐줄게.”라며 독수리가 말하더니 발톱으로 거북을 집어 들곤 손살 같이 날아올라 거의 구름 높이까지와 거북을 놓아주었어요.
그러자 떨어지며 나는 듯 하다가 곧장 높이 솟은 산으로 떨어져 껍질이 산산조각 박살이 나고 말았답니다.
거북이 마지막 숨을 몰아쉬며 탄식했어요.
“난 이래도 싸. 날개와 구름이 나랑 무슨 상관이 있다는 거니, 난 그저 땅 위에서도 어렵게 어렵게 기어다니는 동물인데.”
소망이 이루어졌다 마냥 좋아할 일이 아니랍니다, 곧 파멸이 다가올 수 있으니까요.

28. The Flies and the Honey-Pot
28. 파리들과 꿀단지 (이솝 우화)
​

A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.”
Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.
꿀단지를 발견한 수많은 파리들이 가정주부의 방을 잔뜩 뒤덮었어요.
그들은 자신들의 팔을 꿀단지에 담가 탐욕스럽게 맛을 보았죠.
하지만 발을 꿀에 담그면 담글수록 자연스레 그들의 날개 또한 꿀에 젖어 날 수 없게 되었지요.
결국 그들은 꿀의 끈적거림에 빠져나오지 못하고 익사하게 되었답니다.
마지막 숨을 몰아쉬며 파리들이 탄식하며 말했어요.
“오 우리처럼 이렇게 미련한 것이 또 있을까, 꿀 조금 맛보려다 스스로를 파멸로 이끌고 말았으니 말이야.”
즐거움엔 고통이 따르는 법이랍니다.

A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented “a Lion strangled by a Man.” The traveler pointed to it and said: “See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.” The Lion replied: “This statue was made by one of you men. If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man placed under the paw of the Lion.”

30. 농부와 학들


30. The Farmer and the Cranes
30. 농부와 학들 (이솝 우화)
​

SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great number.
몇몇 학(새의 종류)들이 일부 땅에 자신들의 경작지를 만들고 밀 씨를 새로 뿌렸어요.
한참 후 농부가 고무줄 새총을 휘두르며 나타나더니 학들에게 공포감을 줘 죄다 쫓아내버렸어요.
하지만 곧 새들은 그 고무줄 새총이 그냥 빈 새총이며 허공에서 흔들릴 뿐이란 사실을 알게 되었지요.
학들은 이제 고무줄 새총 따위엔 꿈쩍도 안하고 달아나지도 않게 되었어요.
이걸 본 농부는 고무줄 새총에 돌들을 재더니(장전하더니) 수많은 학들을 정말로 죽였어요.
​
​
The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying to each other, “It is time for us to be off to Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest what he can do.”
If words suffice not, blows must follow.
그 즉시 남은 새들이 자신의 땅을 포기하고 날아오르며 서로 외쳐댔어요.
“이제 ‘난쟁이 나라’(걸리버 여행기에 나오는 나라이름)로라도 가야할 때가 왔어. 저 사람이 우리를 그냥 겁주는 것에 만족해하지 않고, 이제 정말로 자신이 무얼 할 수 있는가를 보이기 시작했으니까.”

32. 여우와 염소


32. The Fox and the Goat
32. 여우와 염소 (이솝 우화)
​

A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape. A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape.
하루는 여우가 깊은 우물 속에 빠지고 말았어요. 그런데 도무지 빠져나갈 방법이 없지 뭐예요.
그때 목이 마르던 염소가 우연히도 그 우물에 왔다 여우를 보곤 물었어요.
“물 맛 좋니?”
자신의 난처한 상황을 숨기고서 여우는 아주 쾌활한 듯 말했어요.
“응 꿀맛이야. 정말 이루 말로 다 표현할 수가 없을 정도야. 너도 내려와 마셔봐.”
오직 목마름을 풀 생각뿐이었던 염소는 아무 것도 생각하지 않고 그냥 뛰어내려 벌컥벌컥 물을 마셨어요.
그런 다음 여우는 “우리 둘 다 어려움에 처하게 되었으니 여길 빠져나갈 방법을 같이 생각해보자”고 말했지요.
​

“If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.”
Look before you leap.
곧 여우가 말했어요. “만약 말이야, 네 앞발을 벽에 기대고 고개를 숙인다면, 내가 내 등을 타고 올라가 위로 갈 수 있을 거야, 그럼 내가 널 꺼내줄게.”
염소도 선 듯 동의했고, 여우는 잽싸게 염소의 등을 밟고 올라가선 염소의 뿔을 디디고 올라 기여이 우물에서 나올 수 있었어요.
그 즉시 여우가 재빨리 달아나려했답니다.
염소가 “왜 약속을 깨니?”라며 비난하고 나섰어요.
그랬더니 여우가 고개를 염소에게로 돌리더니 소리쳤지요.
“이 바보 멍청아! 네 수염 털의 개수만큼이라도 네 머릿속에 두뇌가 있었더라면, 한번 들어가면 다신 못 빠져나오는 그런 곳에 스스로 들어가는 그런 일은 처음부터 없었을 거 아냐. 이건 네 탓이라고!”
아셨죠, 돌다리도 두드려 보고 건너세요.

33. 곰과 두 여행자


33. The Bear and the Two Travelers
33. 곰과 두 여행자 (이솝 우화)
​

TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could.
두 남자가 함께 여행을 하고 있었어요.
그때 곰 한 마리가 불쑥 그들이 가는 길에 나타났지요.
두 남자 중 한 사람은 급히 나무로 기어 올라가 나뭇가지들 사이에 몸을 숨겼어요.
하지만 다른 남자는 너무 놀랐던지라 그냥 땅에 냅다 드러눕고 말았어요.
곰이 오더니 코로 그를 더듬으며 온 몸을 냄새 맡았어요.
남자는 숨을 꾹 참고 할 수 있는 최대한 죽은 척을 하고 있었죠.
​
​
The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. “He gave me this advice,” his companion replied. “Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.”
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.
곰이 곧 떠났어요. 왜냐면 곰은 죽은 시체엔 손도 까딱하지 않기 때문이지요.
안전이 확인되자, 나무에 올라가 있던 여행자가 아래로 내려오더니 농담조로 “곰이 자네 귀에다 대고 뭐라 속삭이는 거 같던데, 그래 뭐라 그러던가?”라고 말했어요.
“충고를 하나 해주더군,”라며 친구가 대꾸했어요. “위험에 처한 자넬 내버려두고 간 친구와는 다시 여행하지 말라더군.”
불행할 때 친구가 진짜 친구랍니다(원문→불행은 친구의 진정성을 시험해줍니다).

34. 황소와 굴대(바퀴 회전의 중심축) (이솝 우화)
​

A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen. The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: “Hullo there! why do you make so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.”
Those who suffer most cry out the least.
무거운 짐마차를 끌고서 시골길을 따라 한 떼(무리)의 황소들이 길을 가고 있었어요.
그런데 굴대(바퀴 회전의 중심축인 쇠막대기나 나무 막대기. 다음Daum 국어사전 참조)들이 삐걱삐걱 지독한 신음소리를 내는 거예요.
보다 못한 황소들이 고개를 돌려 수레바퀴들에게 이렇게 말했어요.
“어이 거기! 왜 그리 시끄러워? 일은 우리가 다 하는데, 비명을 질러도 너희가 아니라 우리가 질러야 되는 거 아냐.”
고생하는 사람 따로 불평하는 사람 따로 인가요(원문→묵묵히 참고 견디는 사람은 불평을 하지 않는 법입니다).

35. 목마른 비둘기 (이솝 우화)
​

A PIGEON, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water painted on a signboard. Not supposing it to be only a picture, she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard, jarring herself terribly. Having broken her wings by the blow, she fell to the ground, and was caught by one of the bystanders.
Zeal should not outrun discretion.
엄청 목이 마르던 비둘기가 간판 위에 그려진, 물이 담긴 잔 그림을 보았어요.
그게 그림일 거란 생각은 전혀 못한 비둘기는 엄청 푸드덕거리며 그리고 날아갔다 그만 간판에 정통으로 쿵하고 부딪히고 말았어요. 그 바람에 몸에 엄청난 충격을 받은 비둘기의 두 날개가 부러져서 비둘기는 땅에 떨어지고 말았답니다.
그러자 그 모습을 보고 있던 구경꾼들 중 한 명이 잽싸게 그 비둘기를 낚아채가고 말았답니다.
신중해서 나쁠 건 없답니다(원문→열의가 분별을 앞서게 하지 마세요).

36. The Raven and the Swan
36. 까마귀와 백조 (이솝 우화)
​

A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage. Supposing that the Swan’s splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools. But cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could not change their color, while through want of food he perished.
Change of habit cannot alter Nature.
백조를 본 까마귀가 자기도 그처럼 아름다운 깃털을 가지고 싶어졌어요.
백조의 찬란한 흰색이 그가 헤엄치는 물에서 목욕을 즐겨하기 때문이라 여긴, 까마귀는 자신이 음식을 주워먹고 살던 정든 제단(교회의 탁자)을 떠나, 호수와 못에 정착했어요.
그래서 항시 깃털을 깨끗이 씻었죠.
그런데 아무리 씻어도 자신의 검정색은 변하지 않는 거예요. 게다가 거긴 음식도 부족해 까마귀는 결국 죽고 말았답니다.
버릇이 바뀐다고, 고유한 특성(본성)까지 변하는 건 아니랍니다.

37. 염소와 염소를 돌보는 사람 (이솝 우화)
​

A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, “Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent.”
Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.
‘염소를 돌보는 사람’이 딴 길로 샌(들어선) 염소를 도로 무리로 오게 하려고 무진장 애를 쓰고 있었어요.
휘파람도 불러보고 뿔피리로 소리도 내보았지만 모두 헛수고였어요.
낙오자(염소)가 그런 신호들에 눈길도 주지 않았기 때문이지요.
마침내 ‘염소를 돌보는 사람’이 돌멩이 하나를 던졌는데 그만 그 돌이 염소의 뿔을 맞추어 뿔이 부러지고 말았어요.
‘염소를 돌보는 사람’이 이 일을 주인님께 말하지 말라며 염소에게 빌었어요.
염소가 대답했지요.
“흥, 가소로우시기는, 제가 가만있어도 이 뿔이 얘기를 다 해버릴 텐데요.”

38. 구두쇠와 금덩이


38. The Miser
38. 구두쇠와 금덩이 (이솝 우화)
​

A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations.
구두쇠가 자신의 전 재산을 팔아서 금덩이 하나를 구입해, 담벼락 한쪽 옆 땅에 구멍을 파 묻어두고는, 매일 같이 찾아가 보고 왔어요.
그의 하인들 중 한 명이 주인의 행동을 수상히 여기고 뒤를 밟았지요.
하인은 곧 그게 주인이 숨긴 비밀 보물임을 알게 되어, 땅을 파 금덩이를 들곤 튀어버렸지요.
다음날 거기에 온 주인은 텅 빈 구멍만 발견했을 뿐이었죠. 그러자 그가 머리카락을 쥐어뜯으며 크게 통곡했어요(울었어요).
​

A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, “Pray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.”
그 이유를 알게 된 이웃이 말했어요.
“슬퍼하지 마세요, 그러지 말고 돌을 하나 가져와 같은 장소에 묻고 그게 금덩이라 여기시면 되지 않습니까. 어차피 그러려고 산 금덩이고, 금이 거기 있든 없든 쓰지 않을 참이시든 건 같잖아요.”

39. 아픈 사자


39. The Sick Lion
39. 아픈 사자 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness should be publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful distance, and asked him how he was.
나이 들어 드는 혼자 힘으로 먹이를 구할 수 없게 된 사가자 꾀를 하나 냈어요.
사자는 자기 굴에 들어가 그냥 드러누워 짐짓 무척 아픈 척을 했지요. 그리곤 끙끙 앓는 흉내를 내며 자기가 아픈 게 널리 알려지게 했지요.
짐승들이 슬픔을 표시하며 사자의 굴로 병문안을 오면, 사자는 냉큼 잡아먹어버렸답니다.
수많은 짐승들이 이렇게 당해 사라졌답니다.
이제 여우가 병문안을 올 차례가 되었는데 여우는 사자의 속셈을 눈치 채고는 동굴 밖에 서서 먼 거리를 유지하며 사자에게 “병은 좀 괜찮으세요?”라고 물었어요.
​

“I am very middling,” replied the Lion, “but why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.” “No, thank you,” said the Fox. “I notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.”
He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.
“여전히 그저 그래,”라며 사자가 대꾸했어요. “근데 왜 들어오지 않고 거기 서 있나? 어서 들어와 얘기나 나누세.”
“아뇨, 사양하겠습니다.”라며 여우가 말했어요. “당신 동굴로 들어가는 발자국들은 수도 없이 있는데, 이제 보니 다시 나온 발자국은 하나도 없군요.”
다른 이의 불행을 보고 현명해질 줄을 알아야 해요.

41. 당나귀와 애완견


41. The Ass and the Lapdog
41. 당나귀와 애완견 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm.
한 남자가 당나귀와 몰타(지중해의 섬나라. 이탈리아 아래쪽과 북아프리카 사이에 있는 섬) 산(출신) 애완견을 한 마리씩 가지고 있었어요. 특히나 애완견은 무척이나 아름다웠답니다.
당나귀는 마구간에서 키워졌는데 귀리도 많이 주고 건초도 많이 먹여, 여타 다른 당나귀들과 같은 대우를 받았지요.
애완견은 재주가 많아 주인의 사랑을 독차지하고 있었죠. 주인은 어찌나 애완견이 귀엽덥지 이따금씩 바깥 저녁식사 자리에 다녀오고 나면 으레 애완견이 먹을 음식을 조금씩 싸가지고 왔을 정도였지요.
반면 당나귀는 맷돌을 돌려 옥수수 가루를 만들어야했고 또 숲이든 수풀이든 농장에서 땔나무를 집으로 날라야했지요.
​

He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master’s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back.
이렇듯 힘든 일을 해야 하는 당나귀는 종종 자신의 불운을 한탄해하며 사치스럽고 게으르게 노는 애완견의 삶을 자신과 비교하며 넋두리를 놓곤 했지요.
그러다 마침내 꼭지가 돈 당나귀가 자신의 고삐와 끈을 끊고 한달음에 주인의 방으로 뛰어 들어가 이것저것 따지지도 않고 자신의 뒤꿈치들로 걷어차고 할 수 있는 한 까짓것 껑충껑충 뛰어 돌아다니고 꼬리를 치며 아양을 부렸어요.
급기야 당나귀는, 애완견이 하는 걸 본 대로, 주인의 무릎에 뛰어들려했지요. 그 바람에 식탁이 뒤집어지고 그 위에 놓여 있던 접시들이 산산조각이 나 버렸어요.
그러고도 만족을 하지 않은 당나귀는 주인을 핥으려고 시도했고 또 주인 등에 타고 올랐어요.
​​

The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: “I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little Lapdog!”
아수라장이 나는 소리를 들은 하인들이 주인이 위급함을 눈치 채곤 급히 달려와 주인을 구하고, 발로 차고 몽둥이로 때리고 손바닥으로 때리고 하면서 그 당나귀를 마구간으로 도로 몰고 갔어요.
죽을 정도로 흠뻑 두들고 맞고서 간신히 자신의 마구간으로 되돌아온 당나귀가 다음과 같이 한탄해하며 말했어요.
“이렇게 되도 싸지! 친구 당나귀들과 일하는 것에 만족이나 하면 되는 것을, 굳이 하루 종일 놀기나 하는 별 볼일 없는 애완견이 되어보겠다고 이 생난리를 피웠으니, 내가 왜 이랬을까?”

A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. “And you,” they said, “how many sons have you at a birth?’ The Lioness laughed at them, and said: “Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion.”
The value is in the worth, not in the number.
들판의 동물들 사이에 논쟁이 한창이었어요.
“새끼를 많이 낳는 것으로 그 동물의 우수성을 입증할 수 있느냐?”라는 문제였죠.
그들이 서로 따지다 안 되니 암사자에게 가 이 논쟁의 끝을 맺어달라 청했어요.
“그럼 당신은,”라며 그들이 말했어요. “몇 명의 자녀들을 출산하셨나요?”
그러자 암사자가 웃으며 말했어요.
“이런! 저는 한 명만 낳았답니다. 하지만 그게 바로 백수(온갖 짐승)의 왕인 사자랍니다.”
사물의 가치는 그 수가 많고 적음에 있지 않아요.

Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a distance that no man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there were in Rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses. One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: “Now, my good man, if this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this to be Rhodes, and leap for us.”
방금 막 외국을 여행하고 고향으로 돌아온 사람이 한껏 자랑을 해대고 있었어요.

A CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable excuse for eating him. He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing in the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The Cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they might rise in time for their labors. The Cat replied, “Although you abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain supperless”; and he made a meal of him.

The Sheep and the Goat complained of his distressing cries, saying, “He often handles us, and we do not cry out.” To this the Pig replied, “Your handling and mine are very different things. He catches you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very life.”
어린돼지가, 염소와 양과 함께 울타리 안에 넣어졌어요.

이 말에 어린돼지가 발끈해하며 말했어요.

A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to him, “Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.”

“그 반개(손에 쥔 개암열매들의 반개)로라도 만족하고, 손 빼면 되잖니.”
아셨죠, 한꺼번에 너무 많은 시도는 금물이랍니다.

47. 사랑에 빠진 사자


47. The Lion in Love
47. 사랑에 빠진 사자 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both. The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.
사자는 나무꾼의 딸과 결혼을 하고 싶었어요.
아빠는 전혀 그럴 마음이 없었지만 그렇다고 사자의 청을 거절하기도 무서워서 빠져나갈 궁리를 생각하기에 이르렀어요.
“딸아이의 상대로 사자를 맞이하려면 한 가지 조건이 있네. 자네 이빨을 제거하고 발톱들도 다 자르고 오게나. 딸애가 그걸 끔찍이도 두려워하거든.”
사자는 흔쾌히 그 제안을 받아들였지요.
이빨도 없고 발톱도 없는 사자가 다시 돌아와 결혼을 신청하자, 두려움이 사라진 나무꾼이 몽둥이로 사자를 두들겨 패 숲으로 쫓아버렸답니다.

48. 노동자와 뱀


48. The Laborer and the Snake
48. 노동자와 뱀 (이솝 우화)
​

A SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, inflicted a mortal bite on the Cottager’s infant son. Grieving over his loss, the Father resolved to kill the Snake. The next day, when it came out of its hole for food, he took up his axe, but by swinging too hastily, missed its head and cut off only the end of its tail. After some time the Cottager, afraid that the Snake would bite him also, endeavored to make peace, and placed some bread and salt in the hole.
시골집 대문 근처에 구멍을 파고 살고 있던 뱀이, 그 집주인의 갓난 아들을 물어 치명적인 상처를 입히는 바람에 갓난 아들이 죽고 말았어요.
아들을 잃은 슬픔에 아빠는 반드시 그 뱀을 죽이고 말리라 결심하기에 이르렀어요.
다음날 먹이를 구하러 뱀이 나오자, 아빠가 도끼를 번쩍 치켜들곤 단번에 내리쳤어요.
뱀의 머리는 놓쳤지만 다행히도 뱀의 꼬리 끝부분은 자를 수 있었지요.
죽지 않은 뱀이 아빠 자신 또한 물 것을 걱정한 아빠가 사이좋게 지내자며 다독이며 뱀 구멍에 빵 조금과 소금 몇 개를 놓아주었어요.
​

The Snake, slightly hissing, said: “There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son.”
No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the injury.
그러자 뱀이 야유를 보내며 말했어요.
“이제부터 당신과 나 사이에 평화는 없어요. 나는 이제 당신만 보면 내 잘려나간 꼬리가 생각날 테고, 당신도 나만 보면 죽은 아들 생각이 날 텐데 어떻게 사이좋게 지낼 수 있겠어요.”
상처를 준 당사자가 앞에 있는데, 어떻게 그 상처가 잊히겠어요.

49. 양가죽을 쓴 늑대


49. The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing
49. 양가죽을 쓴 늑대 (이솝 우화)
​

ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in order to secure food more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the shepherd, returning to the fold during the night to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly.
Harm seek. harm find.
옛날에 한번은 늑대가 변장을 하고서 보다 쉽게 먹잇감을 획득할 꿍꿍이를 품었답니다.
그래서 그는 양가죽을 뒤집어쓰고서, 양떼무리 속에 파고 들었죠, 그가 쓴 양가죽 덕분에 양치기조차도 속일 수 있었거든요.
저녁이 되자 양치기는 늑대도 양떼와 함께 양우리(양의 집)에 넣고 문을 잠그고 문단속도 단단히 했죠.
하지만 그 양치기 곧 양우리로 되돌아왔어요. 내일 먹을 고기를 얻기 위해서였죠. 그러다 양치기는 그 늑대를 양으로 착각하고서 붙잡아 즉시 죽여 버렸답니다.

50. 당나귀와 노새


50. The Ass and the Mule
50. 당나귀와 노새 (이솝 우화)
​

A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass and a Mule, both well laden. The Ass, as long as he traveled along the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear. He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request.
노새몰이꾼이 길을 막 떠났어요. 그는 당나귀와 노새에 짐을 잔뜩 실어 앞에 몰고 갔지요.
평평한 땅을 가는 동안은 당나귀도 짐이 썩 무겁지 않았지만, 일단 가파른 산길을 오르기 시작하자 짐이 여간 무거운 게 아니었어요.
그래서 자기 짐을 조금만 덜어 달라 친구에게 부탁했지요. 그럼 나머지 짐으로 집까지 편히 갈 수 있을 거 같았거든요.
하지만 노새는 그 부탁을 들은 척도 하지 않았어요.
​
​
The Ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden. Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him. The Mule, groaning beneath his heavy burden, said to himself: “I am treated according to my deserts. If I had only been willing to assist the Ass a little in his need, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as well.”
그 후 곧 당나귀가 짐의 무게에 눌러 쓰러지고 말았지요.
이제 어쩔 수 없이 노새몰이꾼이 당나귀가 나르던 짐을 노새의 등에 올려놓았죠. 이제 노새는 자신이 원래 이고 가던 짐에다가 당나귀의 짐까지 더 얹어가게 생겼어요.
무거운 짐의 무게에 짓눌리며 끙끙 앓던 노새가 혼잣말로 중얼거렸어요.
“내가 판 무덤이지. 당나귀가 조금만 도와달라고 할 때 도와주었더라면, 이런 꼴은 안 당하는 건데.”

51. 왕을 바라는 개구리들


51. The Frogs Asking for a King
51. 왕을 바라는 개구리들 (이솝 우화)
​

THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King. Perceiving their simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake. The Frogs were terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool. But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in contempt.
개구리들이 큰 상심(슬픔)에 빠졌어요.
“우린 지도자가 없잖아.”
그래서 제우스 신에게 대표단을 보내 “저희들에게도 왕을 주세용~♥”라고 애걸했어요.
어처구니없는 청에 제우스 신이 그냥 큰 통나무 하나를 호수에 던져주었지요.
“첨벙~”하는 소리에 화들짝 놀란 개구리들이 물에 풍덩 들어가 깊숙이 숨었죠.
하지만 곧 개구리들도 알아차렸어요.
“뭐야, 크기만 하지 움직이질 않네.”
그래서 개구리들이 다시 수면 위로 헤엄쳐 나왔고 급기야는 겁도 없이 그 통나무에 기어올라 털썩 앉아 있기도 했어요.
“우린 이 통나무가 경멸스러워.”
​​

After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King. Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake.
아무리 생각해도 제우스의 이러한 조치가 부당한 거 같아, 개구리들은 두 번째로 대표단을 제우스 신에게 보내,
“다른 왕으로 보내주세용~♥”
라고 간청했어요.
그래서 제우스 신이 개구리들에게 뱀장어를 왕으로 보냈어요.
하지만 그 뱀장어의 성격이 너무 온순하다는 것을 알게 된 개구리들은 세 번째로 대표단을 제우스 신에게 보내,
“다른 왕으로 보내주세용~♥”
라고 간청했어요.
이렇듯 하도 불평을 해대는 개구리들 때문에 짜증이 난 제우스 신이 이번엔 왜가리(몸길이 1미터. 개구리를 잡아먹는 새. 백로와 비슷하게 생겼음. 도시의 개천에 보이는 새는 학이 아니라 대부분 왜가리임)를 왕으로 보내주었고, 그 왜가리는 도착하자마자 개구리들을 하루에 한 마리씩 잡아먹는 통에 결국 호수에서 개구리 울음소리가 싹 사라지고 말았답니다.

몇몇 소년들이 연못 가까이서 놀다 물에 개구리들이 많이 있는 걸 보곤, 돌을 던져 맞추기 시작했어요.
그 바람에 몇몇 개구리들이 맞아죽었죠.
그러자 보다 못한 개구리 한 마리가 수면 위로 고개를 들며 아우성쳤어요.

A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the means of living.
Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.

54. 소금장수와 당나귀


54. The Salt Merchant and His Ass
54. 소금장수와 당나귀 (이솝 우화)
​

A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired.
행상인(이곳저곳을 돌아다니며 물건을 파는 상인)이 자신의 당나귀를 몰고서 소금을 팔러 바닷가로 가고 있었죠.
그러다 시냇물을 건너게 되었는데 그만 발을 헛딛다 풍덩하고 물에 빠지고 말았어요.
그런데 다시 물 밖으로 나와 보니 등에 지고 잇던 짐이 훨씬 더 가벼워져 있지 뭐예요, 물에 소금들이 녹았기 때문이죠.
다음날 행상인(상인)은 자신의 당나귀의 등 짐바구니에 어제보다 훨신 더 많은 소금을 싣고 길을 재촉하고 있었어요.
그러다 어제 그 시냇물에 다다랐는데, 당나귀가 똑같은 장소에서 고의적으로 또 풍덩 쓰러져 일어나는 바람에 가지고 간 짐이 다 녹아 사라지고 말았죠. 이에 당나귀는 바라던 바라는 듯 무척이나 의기양양해했답니다.
​

The Peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.
그제야 당나귀의 꿍꿍이속을 알게 된 행상인이 셋째 날에 해안가로 갈 때는 소금 대신 스펀지를 한 짐 가득 싣었어요.
같은 장소에 이르자 당나귀는 재미를 보려고 고의적으로 시냇물에 또 쓰러졌답니다.
하지만 이번에는 달랐죠. 스펀지가 그만 물을 왕창 빨아들이는 바람에 당나귀의 짐이 엄청나게 무거워졌거든요.
그리하여 당나귀는 자기 꾀에 자기가 넘어가 이후로는 두 배나 많은 짐을 맨날 이고 가야했답니다.

55. 소들과 푸줏간 주인들

55. 소들과 푸줏간 주인들 (이솝 우화)
​

THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who practiced a trade destructive to their race. They assembled on a certain day to carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns for the contest. But one of them who was exceedingly old (for many a field had he plowed) thus spoke: “These Butchers, it is true, slaughter us, but they do so with skillful hands, and with no unnecessary pain. If we get rid of them, we shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double death: for you may be assured, that though all the Butchers should perish, yet will men never want beef.”
Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.
옛날 옛적에, 도저히 참다못한 소들이 모여 ‘푸줏간 주인’(정육점 주인)들을 해칠 계획을 논의하고 있었어요.
푸줏간 주인들이 자신들의 파괴적인 직업을 충실히 이행하는 탓에 소들이 남아나질 않는다는 의견이었죠.
그래서 특정한 날 특정한 시간에 모여 함께 일을 도모하기로 했어요. 일단 그날까지 각자 자신의 뿔을 날카롭게 갈자 각오를 다졌죠.
그때 소들 중 한 명, 그러니까 지극히도 나이가 많은 소, 수많은 밭들을 쟁기로 갈아온 소들 중 가장 나이 많은 소가 나서더니 이렇게 말했어요.
“푸줏간 주인들이 우리를 도축하는 게 맞다만, 그래도 그들은 솜씨 좋은 기술로 고통 없이 그 일을 한다네. 만약 우리들이 그들을 모두 해치고 나면, 우린 전혀 솜씨 없는 자들의 손에 맡겨지게 돼 고통이 두 배가 될 걸세. 여러분들도 잘 알고 있지 않는가, 세상의 모든 푸줏간 주인들이 사라진들, 인간들이 소고기를 안 먹는 날은 없을 거란 걸 말일세.”
급격한 변화를 도모하다 또 다른 악의 축과 만날 수 있답니다.

A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer’s day, fell fast asleep in his den. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner of his den to find the Mouse. A Fox seeing him said: “A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of a Mouse.” “’Tis not the Mouse I fear,” said the Lion; “I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding.”

57. 허영심 강한 갈까마귀(작은 까마귀)

57. 허영심 강한 갈까마귀(작은 까마귀) (이솝 우화)
​

JUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to create a sovereign over the birds, and made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful among them to be king. The Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body, hoping thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all.
제우스(그리스 신화 최고의 신)가 마음을 굳히곤 다음과 같이 말했어요.
“새들의 왕을 뽑겠노라. 그러니 어느 날까지 모든 새들은 내 앞으로 오거라, 그럼 내가 그 중 가장 아름다운 새를 새들의 왕으로 선택하리라.”
자신이 못생겼다는 사실을 잘 아는 갈까마귀(작은 까마귀)는 그때부터 숲과 들판을 다 뒤져서 친구 새들의 날개에서 떨어진 깃털들을 주워 자신의 몸에 꽂았어요. 그렇게 하면 자신이 가장 아름다운 새가 될 수 있을 거란 헛된 희망을 품고서 말이죠.
​​

When the appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered finery. But when Jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each plucked from him his own feathers, leaving the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw.
약속할 날이 되어 새들이 제우스 앞에 모였을 때, 갈까마귀 또한 아름다운 깃털을 하고서 나타났어요.
그 바람에 제우스는 갈까마귀의 깃털이 가장 아름답다며 새들의 왕으로 선택하려했어요. 그 즉시 모든 새들이 반발하고 나서며 와락 갈까마귀에게 달려들더니 자신들의 깃털을 뽑아버렸죠.
그러자 갈까마귀의 모습은 흔해 빠진 일반 갈까마귀일 뿐이었지요.

58. The Goatherd and the Wild Goats
58. ‘염소를 돌보는 사람’과 야생 염소들 (이솝 우화)
​

A GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own for the night. The next day it snowed very hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains.
‘염소를 돌보는 사람’이 자신의 염소 떼를 몰고 풀밭에 갔는데, 저녁 무렵 보니 몇몇 야생 염소들이 자신의 염소 떼와 섞여있지 않겠어요. 그래서 그는 밤에 그들 모두를 데리고 와 가두었지요.
다음날 눈이 펑펑 와서, 그는 염소 떼를 평소처럼 풀밭으로 데려가지 않고 우리에서 먹게 했어요.
그는 자신의 원래 염소들에게는 간신히 굶지 않을 만큼만 먹이를 주었지만, 새로운 야생 염소들에게는 정말이지 풍부한 양의 먹이를 주었죠. 그렇게 하면 야생 염소들이 자기와 계속 머물고 싶어 할 테고 그럼 모두 자기의 염소들이 되리라는 부푼 기대에 들떴지요.
눈이 녹고, 그가 그들 모두를 데리고 다시 풀밭으로 갔을 때, 야생 염소들이 빠른 속도로 산으로 달아나는 게 아니겠어요.
​
​
The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them, turning about, said to him: “That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves.”
Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones.
‘염소를 돌보는 사람’이 그들의 배은망덕함을 꾸짖었어요.
“눈보라가 몰아치는 동안 내가 너희들을 먹여주고 돌봐주었거늘 이렇게 내빼느냐!”
그러자 야생 염소들 중 한 마리가 뒤를 돌아보며 말했어요.
“우리도 신중하다고요. 어제 당신은 우리들을 원래 키우던 염소들보다 더 잘 대우해주었어요. 그럼 우리 다음에 또 다른 염소들이 오면 그들을 우리보다 더 잘 대해주겠죠. 이렇듯 우리가 어떻게 대우받을지 뻔히 아는데, 우리가 당신과 머물겠어요?”
새 친구를 위한다고 정든 친구들을 괄시하면 안돼요.

59. 짓궂은 개 (이솝 우화)
​

A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to bite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about his neck so that the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went. Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the marketplace. One day an old hound said to him: Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not, believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered dog.”
Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
개가 한 마리 있었는데, 이 개는 마주치는 모든 사람들에게 왈칵 달려드는가 하면 느닷없이 물기까지 했어요.
그래서 그 주인이 개의 목에 방울을 달아 개가 어디에 있든 알 수 있게 조치했어요.
그걸 상으로 여긴 개는 여간 뻐기지 않으며 온 시장바닥을 누비며 자랑을 해댔어요, 방울을 딸랑거리며 말이죠.
보다 못한 하루는 나이 든 개가 말했죠.
“그게 자네에게 주어진 상 같은가? 그 방울은 자랑이 아니라, 불명예의 표식이네, 공공장소에서 모든 사람들에게 자네가 짓궂은 개이니 피하라는 신호 말일세.”
악명을 종종 명성으로 착각하는 이들이 있답니다.

60. 꼬리 잘린 여우


60. The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail
60. 꼬리 잘린 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation. He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. One of them interrupting him said, “If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us.”
여우가 덫에 걸렸다 가까스로 탈출했어요. 하지만 그 과정에서 자신의 꼬리를 잃고 말았죠.
그때부터 여우는 남들 앞에 나서는 게 너무도 창피하고 부끄러웠어요. 그래서 꾀를 하나 냈죠. 즉 다른 모든 여우들이 자신들의 꼬리를 없앤다면 자신의 결핍도 눈에 띄지 않을 거란 거였죠.
그래서 여우가 수많은 여우들을 모아놓고 공개적으로 충고를 하고 나섰어요.
“너희들 꼬리 잘라봐, 그럼 보기에도 더 좋을 뿐 아니라, 꼬리의 무게만큼 몸도 가벼워진단다. 이보다 더 편할 수가 없어.”
여우들 중 한 명이 끼어들며 말했어요.
“어이 친구, 네가 그렇게 꼬리를 잃지 않았어도 네가 우리에게 그렇게 말했을까?”

61. 소년과 쐐기풀


61. The Boy and the Nettles
61. 소년과 쐐기풀 (이솝 우화)
​

A BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother, saying, “Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently.” “That was just why it stung you,” said his Mother. “The next time you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you.”
Whatever you do, do with all your might.
한 소년이 쐐기풀(잎과 줄기에 많은 털이 있고 만지면 벌에 쏘인 거처럼 따가움. 우리나라 산에 많이 있음)에 쏘였어요.
소년는 집으로 달려가 엄마에게 말했어요.
“전 그냥 닿기만 했는데 그게 절 아주 세게 쏘았어요.”
“그게 바로 네가 쏘인 이유란다,”라며 엄마가 말했어요. “다음번에 쐐기풀에 손이 닿을 거 같으면, 대담하게 확 움켜쥐려무나. 그럼 그게 비단만큼 부드러워질 게다. 적어도 널 다치게 하진 못할 게다.”
무엇을 하든 온힘을 다해 하세요.

62. 남자와 두 애인


62. The Man and His Two Sweethearts
62. 남자와 두 애인 (이솝 우화)
​

A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two women at the same time. One of them was young, and the other well advanced in years. The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself, made a point, whenever her admirer visited her, to pull out some portion of his black hairs. The younger, on the contrary, not wishing to become the wife of an old man, was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she could find. Thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head.
Those who seek to please everybody please nobody.
중년 남성이 한 명 있었어요. 중년이다 보니 그의 머리도 서서히 세기(회색으로 변하기) 시작했죠.
그러던 그가 동시에 두 여인을 만나게 되었죠.
그녀들 중 한 명은 젊었고, 다른 한 명은 나이가 좀 있었죠.
나이가 좀 있는 여인은 남자가 자기보다 어려보이는 게 창피해서 남자가 자신을 찾아올 때면 그의 검은 머리카락을 조금씩 뽑아버렸어요.
반면 나이가 젊은 여인은 나이 든 남자의 아내가 되는 걸 바라지 않아 눈에 띄는 족족 남자의 회색 머리카락을 죄다 뽑아버렸어요.
그러다보니 두 여인 사이를 오고가던 남자는 곧 자신의 머리에 머리카락 한 올 남아있지 않은 걸 발견하게 되었죠.
모두를 만족시키려는 자는 누구도 만족시킬 수 없는 법이랍니다.

AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars. One evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well. While he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help, a neighbor ran to the well, and learning what had happened said: “Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on earth?’
천문학자가 밤이면 산책을 하며 별들을 관찰하곤 했어요.
그러던 하루는 그가 밤에 교외(도시의 밖) 지역을 거닐며 하늘에 온통 신경을 집중하고 있다 그만 실수로 깊은 우물 속에 빠지고 말았어요.
멍들고 쑤신 게 아프고 슬퍼 큰 소리로 도움을 요청했지요.

“WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?” said the Wolves to the Sheep. “Those evil-disposed Dogs have much to answer for. They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we have done any harm. If you would only dismiss them from your heels, there might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us.” The Sheep, poor silly creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the Dogs, whereupon the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure.
“우리 사이에 어찌하여 두려움과 살○(죽이는 거)이 존재해야하는가?”라며 늑대들이 양들에게 말했어요.
“위선적인 개들이야 말로 이 질문에 답해야한다. 그들은 우리가 너희들에게 다가가기만 하면 짖어대고 마치 우리가 뭔 못된 짓이라도 한 마냥 뒤쫓아 오지. 그러니 너희 양들이 개들을 해고하라고, 그러고 나야만 우리 사이에 진정 평화와 화해가 무르익을 수 있어.”
불쌍하고 어리석었던 동물들인 양들이 그 말에 혹 해 정말로 개들을 해고해버렸어요.

65. 노파와 의사


65. The Old Woman and the Physician
65. 노파와 의사 (이솝 우화)
​

AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses: that if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing. This agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he healed her and demanded the promised payment. The Old Woman, when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give him nothing.
시력을 잃은 노파가 한 명 있었어요.
그래서 치료할 목적으로 의사를 불러 사람들이 있는 앞에서 거래를 했죠.
“눈 먼 걸 낫게 해주면 돈은 엄청 주리다, 하지만 치료하지 못하면 땡전 한 푼도 없어요.”
이 계약은 성사되었고, 의자는 매번 연고(바르는 약)를 그녀의 눈에 발라주었어요.
또한 의사는 매번 방문했다 돌아갈 때마다 그녀의 물건들을 조금씩 훔쳐가기 시작했어요.
그가 노파의 눈을 완전히 치료한 날, 의사는 약속한 돈을 달라 요구했죠.
그런데 노파가 보니 시력이 돌아왔다지만 어찌된 게 집안에 가구가 하나도 보이지 않는 거예요.
그래서 노파는 돈을 한 푼도 안 주려고 했지요.
​

The Physician insisted on his claim, and. as she still refused, summoned her before the Judge. The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued: “This man here speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares that I am healed. I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods: but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it.”
이 일로 의사가 소송을 걸었어요.
그래도 노파가 완강히 돈 지불을 거절했기에, 결국 그녀는 판사 앞에 나가게 되었어요.
법정에 선 노파가 말했어요.
“이 사람(의사)이 말한 게 다 사실입니다요. 제 눈만 낫게 해주면 그에게 많은 돈을 주기로 약속했더랬죠. 하지만 전 여전히 눈이 먼 걸요. 그러니 그에게 한 푼도 줄 수 없어요. 지금 그는 제 눈이 다 치료되었다고 주장하지만 그건 그의 주장일 뿐이고 전 제 눈이 여전히 안 보인다는 확신이 들어요. 왜냐면 제가 시력을 잃었을 때에도 거나마 보였든 여러 가재도구들과 귀중품들이 어째 제 눈이 다 나았다고 그가 말했을 때 하나도 안 보이더란 겁니다요.”

66. 싸움닭들과 독수리 (이솝 우화)
​

TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard. One at last put the other to flight. The vanquished Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might. An Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons. The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery.
Pride goes before destruction.
싸움닭 두 마리가 안마당의 주도권을 놓고 피 터지게 싸우고 있었어요.
그러다 결국 한 마리가 다른 한 마리를 때려눕힐 수 있었죠.
진 수탉은 슬그머니 자리를 떠 마당 구석탱이로 몸을 숨겼어요.
반면 싸움에 이긴 수탉은 푸드덕 높은 담벼락 위로 날아올라 두 날개를 푸다닥거리며 온 땅이 진동할 듯 “꼬꼬댁” 노래를 불렀어요.
바로 그때 하늘을 빙글빙글 돌고 있던 독수리가 수탉의 괴성을 듣곤 당장에 내려와 자신의 날카로운 발톱으로 채가 버렸어요.
그 즉시 싸움에 패한 수탉이 구석에서 나와 의심할 바 없는 안마당의 진정한 지배자가 되었죠.
교만(잘난 체)한 자는 오래가지 못하는 법이에요.

67. The Charger and the Miller
67. 군마(군대 말)와 방앗간 주인 (이솝 우화)
​

A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, “Ah! Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle.” “Forbear,” said the Miller to him, “harping on what was of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune.”
늙고 쇠약해진 군마(군대에서 쓰이는 말)가 전쟁에 나가는 대신 이제 방앗간 일을 도우러 보내졌어요.
말이 좋아 도우러 가는 거지 실상은 전투대신 하루 종일 맷돌을 돌려 가루로 만드는 일을 해야만 했죠.
자신의 운수가 기똥차게 꼬꾸라진 것이 허망해 군마가 농부에게 말했어요.
“아! 방앗간 주인이여, 나도 한때는 목에서 꼬리까지 가린 흰 린네르 천을 두르고서 전장에 나가곤 했지. 그럼 나를 돌보는 마부도 한 명 딸렸었지. 그런데 지금은 이런 방앗간에서 뼈 빠지게 일하는 신세가 됐다니. 나를 이해하시겠소.”
“과거 일을,”라며 방앗간 주인이 말했어요. “그리 장황하게 늘어놓아 뭐하나. 인생엔 길흉화복이 있는 법, 참고 견디는 게 약이네, 인간도 마찬가지라네.”

A MONKEY once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so pleased them all by his performance that they elected him their King. A Fox, envying him the honor, discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap, and leading the Monkey to the place where it was, said that she had found a store, but had not used it, she had kept it for him as treasure trove of his kingdom, and counseled him to lay hold of it. The Monkey approached carelessly and was caught in the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of purposely leading him into the snare, she replied, “O Monkey, and are you, with such a mind as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?”
한번은 원숭이가 동물들 모임에서 춤을 췄어요. 너무도 잘 춰 분위기가 확 뜨자 그 참에 동물들이 원숭이를 왕으로 선출했어요.
엄청 질투심을 느낀 여우가 예전에 보아둔 고기가 놓인 덫으로 원숭이를 데리고 가 말했어요.

원숭이는 조심성 없게도 고기에 다가갔다 덫에 갇히고 말았어요.
그제야 함정인 걸 알아차린 원숭이가 “일부러 그랬지!”라며 여우를 나무랐어요.

69. 말과 ‘말 타는 사람’


69. The Horse and His Rider
69. 말과 ‘말 타는 사람’ (이솝 우화)
​

A HORSE SOLDIER took the utmost pains with his charger. As long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all emergencies and fed him carefully with hay and corn. But when the war was over, he only allowed him chaff to eat and made him carry heavy loads of wood, subjecting him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment.
어느 기병이 자신의 군마(군대에서 사용하는 말)에 엄청 공을 들이고 있었어요.
그러니까 전쟁 기간에는, 그는 스스로를 말의 도우미로 여기고, 뭔 일이 터지든 말든 무슨 일이 있든 말든 좋은 건초와 옥수수를 구해 말에게 정성껏 먹였어요.
근데 전쟁이 끝나니, 말에게 찌꺼기나 먹이고, 그에 더해 무거운 땔나무들을 나르게 하고, 온갖 고된 일과 갖은 구박을 다 하는 거예요.
​

War was again proclaimed, however, and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard, the Soldier put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted, being clad in his heavy coat of mail. The Horse fell down straightway under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his master, “You must now go to the war on foot, for you have transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?’
그러다 전쟁이 또 터지자, 그는 깃발을 드는 기병으로 호출되었답니다.
그 병사는 자신의 군마에 군대 말 옷을 입히고, 무거운 쇠미늘갑옷을 말에게 덮어씌우더니 올라탔어요.
그 무게를 이기지 못한 말이 즉시 풀썩 쓰러지고 말았죠. 몸이 예전 몸이 아니었기 때문이죠.
말이 자기 주인에게 말했어요.
“이제 걸어서 전쟁터에 가시지요. 당신은 나를 영락없는 당나귀로 만들어버렸어요. 그렇게 저를 학대해놓고서 제가 단번에 당나귀에서 말로 도로 돌아올 수 있을 거라 여기신 겁니까?”

THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, “Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?’ The Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly. The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.
신체의 다른 부위들이 위(배)에게 반란을 일으켰어요.

”왜 우리가 네 시중을 들어야하는데, 네가 하루 종일 먹고 놀며 각종 사치와 방종(제멋대로)을 부리는 걸 왜 우리가 도와야하느냐고?“
그래서 신체의 다른 부위들은 단합을 하고서 위를 보좌하는 걸 거부해버렸어요.
곧 온 몸이 급속도로 쇠약해져갔지요, 손이며 발이며 입이며 눈이며 죄다 쇠약해졌어요. 그제야 그들이 자신들의 어리석음을 후회했지만 아쉽게도 때는 이미 늦었답니다.

But I shall not have to wait long for my just revenge; for if you now should crop my leaves, and cut me down to my root, I shall provide the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the sacrifice.”

The Monkey came with the rest and presented, with all a mother’s tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-featured young Monkey as a candidate for the promised reward. A general laugh saluted her on the presentation of her son. She resolutely said, “I know not whether Jupiter will allot the prize to my son, but this I do know, that he is at least in the eyes of me his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of all.”

A WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait on her. She was in the habit of waking them early in the morning, at cockcrow. The maidens, aggravated by such excessive labor, resolved to kill the cock who roused their mistress so early.

A SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, “Wolf! Wolf!” and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains. The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: “Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep”; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.
There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.
마을 인근에서 양 떼를 돌보던 양치기 소년이 “늑대다! 늑대가 나타났다!”라고 외치는 통에 마을 사람들이 서너 차례나 허겁지겁 달려왔더래요.
하지만 막상 이웃들이 소년을 도우려고 와 보면 소년은 그들의 고생을 보며 배꼽을 잡으며 낄낄 웃었더랬죠.
그러다 하루는 늑대가 정말로 나타나고 말았어요.
이번엔 양치기 소년도 깜짝 놀라 고함을 질렀어요.
“제발, 와서 좀 도와주세요. 늑대가 양들을 잡아먹고 있어요.”
하지만 소년의 비명에 누구도 꿈쩍하지 않았답니다. 이번에도 장난으로 치부한 거죠.
그 바람에 어떤 제지도 받지 않은 늑대가 여유롭게 양떼 모두를 죽일 수 있었답니다.
거짓말을 하면 안 돼요, 가장 중요한 진실의 순간조차도, 그가 비록 진실을 말할 때조차도, 아무도 믿지 않으려 들기 때문이지요.

75. 고양이와 새들


75. The Cat and the Birds
75. 고양이와 새들 (이솝 우화)
​

A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag of instruments becoming his profession, went to call on them. He knocked at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did, saying that if they were ill, he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure them. They replied, “We are all very well, and shall continue so, if you will only be good enough to go away, and leave us as we are.”
“뭐라고 새장 속의 새들이 아프다고!”
그 말을 들은 고양이는 냉큼 의사 옷을 구해 입곤 지팡이를 손에 쥐고 마치 진짜 의사인양 의료 가방도 챙겨 새들을 방문했답니다.
“똑! 똑!”
그는 문을 노크하며 참 다정스럽게 “그래 아프신 건 좀 어떠신지요, 문을 열어주신다면 제가 진료를 봐 치료해드리지요.”라고 말했어요.
새들이 대꾸했답니다.
“당신이 썩 꺼지시고 저희를 그냥 내버려두신다면, 저흰 정말이지 괜찮을 거고 앞으로도 더 괜찮을 거예요.”

A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm’s way, saw a Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf, looking up, said, “Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing.”
Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong.
새끼염소가 지붕 위에 서 있는데, 저 멀리 안전한 거리에 막 늑대 한 마리가 지나가고 있는 게 보였어요.
그래서 새끼염소가 늑대를 조롱하고 욕까지 하기 시작했죠.

“이 자식아! 다 들린다. 하지만 나를 조롱하는 건 네가 아니라 네가 밟고 서 있는 그 지붕이란다.”

AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed one of them to death. The Mother coming up, and missing one of her sons, inquired of his brothers what had become of him. “He is dead, dear Mother; for just now a very huge beast with four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with his cloven heel.” The Frog, puffing herself out, inquired, “if the beast was as big as that in size.” “Cease, Mother, to puff yourself out,” said her son, “and do not be angry; for you would, I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness of that monster.”
“벌컥벌컥!”
황소가 물웅덩이에서 물을 마시다 그만 개구리 형제 두 마리 중 한 마리를 밟아 죽이고 말았어요.

엄마 개구리가 몸을 부풀리며 물었어요.
“그 동물이 이따만 하더냐?”
“관두세요, 엄마, 몸을 부풀리지 마세요,”라며 아들이 말했어요. “참으시라고요. 그랬다간 그 괴물 크기로 되기도 전에 몸이 빵하고 터져버릴 테니까요.”

79. 아빠와 두 딸 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other to a tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with her. She said, “All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be well watered.” Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, “I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks might be dried.” He said to her, “If your sister wishes for rain, and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my wishes?’
아빠에게 두 딸이 있었어요.
한 명은 정원사에게 시집을 보냈고요, 또 한 명은 기와(지붕 위의 기와) 제작자에게 시집을 보냈지요.
한참 후 아빠는 두 딸애들이 어찌 사는가 보고 싶어 방문을 했더랬죠.
아빠가 정원사와 결혼한 첫째 딸을 찾아가 어떻게 지내는지, 별 탈은 없는지 물었어요.
첫째 딸이 말했어요.
“덕분에 아주 잘 지내고 있어요. 그런데 한 가지 바람이 있다면, 굵직한 비 좀 자주 왔으면 해요, 사실 정원에 있는 식물들에겐 그만한 게 없거근요.”
곧이어 아빠는 기와 제작자와 결혼한 둘째 딸의 집에도 방문해 어찌 지내는지 물어보았어요.
그녀가 대답했어요.
“더 이상의 바람이 없을 정도로 잘 지내요, 다만 한 가지 바람이 있다면, 건조한 날이 계속 되었으면 해요, 화창하고 맑은 햇빛에서만 벽돌들이 잘 건조되거든요.”
아빠가 그녀에게 말했어요.
“네 언니는 비가 오길 기원하고, 넌 또 건조한 날씨를 바라니, 이 아빠는 누구 편을 들어야 하니?”

​

A FATHER, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given it. He called them to his bedside and said, “My sons, there is a great treasure hid in one of my vineyards.” The sons, after his death, took their spades and mattocks and carefully dug over every portion of their land. They found no treasure, but the vines repaid their labor by an extraordinary and superabundant crop.
죽음의 문턱에 선 아빠는 아들들이 농장에 자신만큼 신경을 써주기를 바랬어요.
그래서 그들을 배게 맡으로 불러 말했지요.
“얘들아, 내 포도밭들 중 하나에 큰 보물이 있단다.”
아빠가 돌아가신 후, 아들들은 삽과 곡괭이들을 가지고 와 온 땅을 다 파보았어요.
하지만 보물을 찾을 수 없었답니다.
다만 그들의 값진 노동 덕분에 포도나무들에선 전에 없는 포도송이들이 풍부하게 생산되었지요.

A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor. Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox from his yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of the occasion. The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a smile to the Heifer: “For this you were allowed to live in idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed.”
어린 암소(아직 새끼를 낳지 않은 어린 암소)가 힘들게 밭을 갈고 있는 황소를 보곤 “어찌하시다 그렇게 힘든 노동을 강요당하는 불행한 운명을 타고나시게 된 거세요?”라고 말했어요.
그 후 얼마 안 돼, 한가위(추수 감사제 같은 거) 축제가 있었어요. 그래서 소주인은 황소의 멍에(소의 목에 거는 둥그렇게 구부러진 막대기. 쟁기와 소를 연결하는 도구)를 벗겨주고 쉴 수 있도록 했지요.
하지만 사람들은 축하의 뜻을 나타내기 위해 그 어린 암소를 새끼줄로 꽁꽁 묶어 제단으로 끌고 갔지요.
그렇게 되는 과정을 지켜보며 황소가 입가에 미소를 지으며 어린 암소보고 말했어요.
“왜 그렇게 너를 자유롭게 살게 놓아주나 봤더니, 제사에 쓰일 소였구나.”

A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice and there hatched seven young birds. A Serpent gliding past the nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings. The Swallow, finding her nest empty, lamented greatly and exclaimed: “Woe to me a stranger! that in this place where all others’ rights are protected, I alone should suffer wrong.”
강남(원문→해외) 갔던 제비가 돌아왔어요. 그녀는 원체 사람들과 함께 사는 걸 좋아했던지라 재판소 담에 둥지를 틀었어요. 곧 일곱 마리의 어린 새들이 알을 깨고 태어났답니다.
그런데 그 담의 구멍에서 뱀 한 마리가 나오더니 아직 갓 태어난 새끼 새들을 몽땅 다 잡아먹어버렸어요.

A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took it home to his Mother. She not only abstained from beating him, but encouraged him. He next time stole a cloak and brought it to her, and she again commended him. The Youth, advanced to adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater value. At last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands bound behind him, was led away to the place of public execution.
한 소년이 학교 반 친구의 참고서를 훔쳐와 엄마에게 드렸어요.
이에 엄마는 크게 나무라는 대신 격려까지 해주었어요.
소년은 다음번에 외투를 훔쳐와 엄마께 드렸고, 엄마는 다시 격려해주었어요.

​
​
His Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in sorrow, whereupon the young man said, “I wish to say something to my Mother in her ear.” She came close to him, and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off. The Mother upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, “Ah! if you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus led to a disgraceful death.”
사람들 틈에서 뒤따라가던 그의 엄마는 애통함에 가슴을 모질게도 쳐댔어요.
그때 젊은이가 말했어요.
“엄마 귀에다 대고 말할게 있어요.”
엄마가 그에게 다가가자, 젊은이는 있는 힘껏 엄마의 귀를 이빨로 물더니 뜯어버렸어요.
배은망덕한 자식이라며 엄마가 신랄하게 그를 비난했지요.
그러자 아들이 대답했어요.
“아! 제가 처음 도둑질을 해 참고서를 엄마께 갔다드렸을 때 저를 나무라기만 하셨어도 제가 지금 이 꼴이 되어 불명예스러운 죽음을 맞이하지는 않았을 텐데요.”

He sat down by the wayside, and throwing down his load, besought “Death” to come. “Death” immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for what reason he had called him.

87. 생쥐와 개구리와 매 (이솝 우화)
​

A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part in the water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their food. After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the Mouse with him.
땅에 사는 생쥐가 어쩌다 그만 개구리와 절친(친한 친구)이 되고 말았어요. 생쥐는 대부분의 삶을 물에서 살자나요.
한번은 장난으로 개구리가 자신의 발을 끈으로 생쥐의 발과 묶었어요.
개구리도 양심은 있던 지라 우선은 생쥐와 개구리 모두 먹을 수 있는 풀밭으로 갔지요.
그런 다음 개구리는 점차 자신이 사는 저수지 쪽으로 갔어요.
물가에 도착한 개구리가 순간 첨벙하고 물에 뛰어들고 말았어요, 생쥐를 끌고서 말이죠.
​
​
The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam croaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft. The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.
Harm hatch, harm catch.
개구리로선 물속이 놀랄 만큼 좋았죠, 그래서 마음껏 수영을 했더랍니다. 정말 좋았거든요.
하지만 불행하게도 우리의 생쥐는 그만 그런 친구 덕에 물에 빠져 죽고 말았어요. 개구리의 발과 끈으로 연결된 생쥐의 시신이 물 위로 떠오르게 되었죠.
이걸 본 매 한 마리가 손살 같이 내려오더니 자신의 날카로운 발톱으로 낚아채 하늘 높이 솟고 말았어요.
생주의 발과 끈으로 연결되어 있던 개구리까지 포로로 끌려가 매에게 잡아먹히고 말았답니다.

A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone who might heal him. A friend, meeting him and learning what he wanted, said, “If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and dip it in the blood from your wound, and go and give it to the Dog that bit you.” The Man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said, “Why? If I should do so, it would be as if I should beg every Dog in the town to bite me.”
Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of injuring you.
개에게 물린 남자가 돌아다니며 자신의 상처를 치료해줄 사람을 수소문하고 있었어요.

“나으려면, 빵 하나를 가져와 자네 상처의 피를 적셔 자네를 문 그 개에게 도로 가 던져주게나.”
이 말 같지도 않은 조언에 기가 찬 남자가 웃음을 터뜨리며 말했어요.

90. 늑대와 양


90. The Wolf and the Sheep
90. 늑대와 양 (이솝 우화)
​

A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in his lair. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him. “For,” he said, “if you will bring me drink, I will find means to provide myself with meat.” “Yes,” said the Sheep, “if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also.”
Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.
개들에게 물려 심한 상처가 난 늑대가 자신의 굴에서 몸져 눕고 있는데, 배가 너무 고픈 거예요, 그래서 때마침 지나가던 양을 불러 세우곤 “바로 옆에 흐르는 개울에서 물 좀 떠다 주겠니?”라고 물었어요.
늑대가 계속 말했어요.
“왜냐면 네가 물을 좀 가져다주면, 내가 고기를 쉽게 구할 수 있을 거 같거든.”
“넷?”라며 양이 말했어요. “제가 당신의 목마름을 해소해주는 날엔, 십중팔구 제 살도 당신한테 내주게 될 거잖아요.”
거짓말은 쉽게 들통 나는 법이에요.

91. 흑인 노예 (이솝 우화)
​

THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color of his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his former masters. On bringing him home he resorted to every means of cleaning, and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings. The servant caught a severe cold, but he never changed his color or complexion.
What’s bred in the bone will stick to the flesh.
흑인 노예를 산 주인이 그가 전 주인의 외면으로 잘 씻질 못해 때가 시꺼멓게 피부에 올라온 걸로 착각했지 뭐예요.
그래서 노예를 집으로 데려오자마자 주인은 그를 깨끗이 하기 위한 모든 수단을 강구했답니다.
노예는 치질 새 없이 문질러 씻고 또 씻어야만했지요.
하지만 엄한 감기만 걸렸을 뿐, 그의 피부와 안색은 전혀 변하지 않았답니다.
타고난 건 변치 않는 법이에요.

A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast and captured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them to the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.
옛날에 자기 일을 천직(하느님이 주신 직업)으로 알고 열심이인 어부가 한 명 있었어요.

93. 사냥꾼과 어부 (이솝 우화)
​

A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish. The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-bag. They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day’s sport. Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after day. Finally a neighbor said to them, “If you go on in this way, you will soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange, and each will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport.”
Abstain and enjoy.
자신의 개들과 함께 들판에서 돌아오던 사냥꾼이 우연히 바구니에 물고기를 담아 집으로 돌아가고 있는 어부와 마주쳤어요.
사냥꾼은 물고기가 탐이 났고, 물고기의 소유자는 상대방 사냥 주머니에 담긴 내용물들이 탐이 났지요.
그래서 그들은 서로의 수확물을 교환하기로 동의했어요.
이 물물교환이 아주 만족스러웠기 때문에 그들은 매일 같이 같은 장소 같은 시간에 만나 교환했죠.
결국 보다 못한 이웃이 그들에게 말했어요.
“그런 식으로 깡그리 다 바꾸는 걸로 하시다간, 물물교환의 즐거움도 곧 잃어지고 원래 자기 수확물들을 계속 가지고 있어질 게요.”
절제하고 즐깁시다.

AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing it backwards and forwards said, “O most delicious! How nice must the Wine itself have been, when it leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a perfume!”

95. 여우와 까마귀 (이솝 우화)
​

A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it in her beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat himself, and by a wily stratagem succeeded. “How handsome is the Crow,” he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of Birds!” This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the Crow: “My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is wanting.”
까마귀 한 마리가 고기조각 하나를 훔쳐선 입에 꼭 물곤 나뭇가지에 앉아 있었답니다.
이걸 본 여우는 그 고기조각을 자신이 대신 먹고 싶어 안달이 났어요. 그래서 잔꾀를 하나 생각해냈죠.
“참 예쁜 까마귀야.”라며 여우는 큰소리로 말했어요. “정말 몸매며 피부며 아름다움 그 자체인 걸! 오, 좋은 목소리만 가졌다면, 정말 새들의 여왕이 되시고도 남겠어!”
이건 모두 여우가 까마귀를 속이려고 하는 말들이었어요.
하지만 한껏 우쭐해진 까마귀는 목소리 자랑도 하고 싶어 큰 소리로 까악까악 울어댔지요.
그 바람에 물고 있던 고기를 떨어뜨리고 말았어요.
여우는 잽싸게 그걸 낚아채 가며 까마귀보고 말했어요.
“존경하는 까마귀 씨, 목소리 좋은 건 알겠는데, 재치가 부족하시군요.”

96. The Two Dogs
96. 개 두 마리 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports, and a Housedog, taught to watch the house. When he returned home after a good day’s sport, he always gave the Housedog a large share of his spoil. The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion, saying, “It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not assist in the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions.” The Housedog replied, “Do not blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others.”
Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.
어느 사람이 개 두 마리를 키우고 있었어요.
사냥개와 집 지키는 개가 그들이었죠.
사냥개는 주인이 사냥을 하는 동안 도우도록 교육을 받았고, 집 지키는 개는 그냥 집을 잘 지키도록 교육받으며 자랐답니다.
사냥에서 돌아오고 나면 주인은 항상 잡은 사냥감들 중 상당한 몫을 집 지키는 개에게도 주었어요.
그게 사냥개의 눈엔 참 아니 꼬았지요.
그래서 사냥개가 자신의 친구보고 뭐라 그랬어요.
“온종일 사냥을 하는 건 힘든 일이라고, 반면 넌 사냥을 돕는 것도 아니면서 어찌해 이토록 많은 사냥감들을 네 몫으로 챙기는 거니.”
집 지키는 개가 대답했어요.
“날 탓하지 말게, 친구, 주인님을 탓하라고. 그는 내게 일 하는 법을 가르쳐주지 않았어, 다만 다른 이의 노력 물에 의지해 살아가도록 했을 뿐이지, 내 탓이 아니라고.”

97. 소외양간에 들어온 수사슴


97. The Stag in the Ox-Stall
97. 소외양간에 들어온 수사슴 (이솝 우화)
​

A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: “O unhappy creature! why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your enemy?’ The Stag replied: “Only allow me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape.”
수사슴이 개들에게 너무 호되게 쫓기다 그만 두려움에 눈이 멀어 위험을 피하고자 농장에 있는 외양간으로 뛰어 들어가 소들 칸막이들 사이로 몸을 숨기고 말았어요.
소들이 친절하게 경고를 주었답니다.
“불쌍한 애야! 너 여기가 어디라고 들어오니, 붙잡히면 어쩌려고?”
수사슴이 대답했어요.
“잠시만 있게 해줘, 친구, 잠시만 머물게, 상황을 봐서 좋게 빠져나갈 기회를 찾아볼게.”
​

At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and failed to notice him. The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly helped him in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: “We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril.”
저녁이 다가오자 목동들이 가축들에게 먹이를 주러 왔어요. 하지만 그들 중 아무도 그 수사슴을 발견하진 못했답니다. 심지어 몇몇 일꾼들과 함께 온 농장 관리인조차도 수사슴 앞을 지나갔지만 보진 못했죠.
그제야 한시름 놓은 수사슴이 자신이 위급할 때 상냥하게 대해준 소들에게 고맙다는 말을 했어요.
소들 중 한 명이 대답했어요.
“우린 정말 네가 잘 됐으면 좋겠어, 위험에서도 빠져나가고 말이야. 그런데 말이지, 네가 다른 일꾼들의 눈을 속일 수 있었을지 몰라도, 일단 농장 주인이 오면 널 단번에 찾아낼 거야, 그럼 넌 끝장이라고.”
​
​
At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: “Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away.” While he thus examined everything in turn, he spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and killed.
그때 농장 주인이 정말로 외양간으로 들어오며 “소들이 왜 이리 제대로 못 먹는 거야”라며 불평을 해대더니 사료(먹이) 선반(물건을 얹는 곳)으로 다가가며 소리쳤어요.
“사료(먹이)가 왜 이리 모자라? 깊이 반도 안 차있음 어쩌자는 거야. 게으른 일꾼 녀석들, 네가 거미줄 없애라고 그렇게 일렀건만.”
농장 주인은 하나하나 빠짐없이 모든 걸 점검하기 시작했답니다.
그때 그의 눈이 그만 밀짚 속에서 밖을 엿보고 있던 그 수사슴의 뿔의 끝과 마주치게 되었죠.
그 순간 농장 주인은 자신의 일꾼들을 부르더니 수사슴은 붙잡아 죽이라 지시했어요.

​

A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep. At shearing time, wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece she sheared the flesh. The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, “Why do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood add to the wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who will kill me in an instant; but if you want my fleece and wool, there is the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me.”
The least outlay is not always the greatest gain.

양이 고통으로 몸부림치며 말했어요.
“왜 저를 다치게 하세요, 주인님? 양털에 제 피도 포함돼야 하는 건가요? 제 살점을 원하시면 저를 단번에 죽일 수 있는 정육점 주인에게 건네면 될 것이고, 제 양털을 원하시는 거라면 저를 다치지 않게 잘 깎을 수 있는 ‘양모 깎는 사람’에게 저를 맡기면 되는 거잖아요.”

A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease. The Lion agreed to assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass gave the Lion the benefit of his greater speed. When they had taken as many beasts as their necessities required, the Lion undertook to distribute the prey, and for this purpose divided it into three shares. “I will take the first share,” he said, “because I am King: and the second share, as a partner with you in the chase: and the third share (believe me) will be a source of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me, and set off as fast as you can.”

AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare whom he sought to make his prey. An archer, who saw the Eagle from a place of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally. The Eagle gave one look at the arrow that had entered his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had been furnished by himself. “It is a double grief to me,” he exclaimed, “that I should perish by an arrow feathered from my own wings.”
독수리 한 마리가 높은 바위 위에 앉아 먹잇감으로 꼭 집어놓은 산토끼의 움직임을 주시하고 있었어요.

103. 사자와 돌고래 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends, since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The Dolphin gladly consented to this request.
사자가 해변을 어슬렁거리다 파도 위로 고개를 내밀고 있던 돌고래를 발견하곤, “친구 하자”고 제안했어요.
“난 지상의 왕, 넌 바다의 왕이니, 우리 둘은 최고의 친구가 될 수 있을 거야.”
돌고래도 그 제안에 선 듯 찬성을 했지요.
​

Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin to help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin replied, “Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon the land.”
머지않아 그 사자가 야생 황소와 불꽃 튀는 육박전을 벌이게 되어 돌고래에게 다급하게 도움을 요청했어요.
돌고래는 비록 선뜻 돕고 싶어도 도무지 그럴 수가 없었죠. 땅으로 한 발자국도 나아갈 수 없었으니까요.
사자가 발끈했어요.
“이 배신자야!”
돌고래도 지지 않고 말했죠.
“그런 게 아니라고, 친구, 날 탓하진 마, 내게 바다에선 최상의 조건을 주었으면서도, 땅에선 조금도 힘을 쓸 수 없게 만든 자연을 탓하라고.”

ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that should fall first. They at once made up their quarrel, saying, “It is better for us to make friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures.”
어느 여름날, 무더위가 한참 기승을 부릴 때, 목이 마른 사자와 멧돼지가 동시에 같은 우물가에 물을 마스러 도착하고야 말았어요. 그것도 작은 우물가에 말이죠.
곧 누가 먼저 마실 것인가를 두고 격렬한 다툼이 시작되다 급기야는 사납게 싸우기 시작했죠.
그때 그들이 잠시 떨어져 숨을 가누다 보니, 저 멀리서 콘도르(독수리) 몇 마리가 사자와 멧돼지 어느 한 쪽이 죽으면 만찬을 즐기려고 기다리고 있는 모습이 보이지 뭐예요.

A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing her greater safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: “O wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come for safety, so much more perilous.”
한쪽 눈이 먼 암사슴이 최대한 안전한 장소를 찾다보니 해안가의 절벽 바로 가까이에서 풀을 뜯곤 했어요.
그녀는 잘 보이는 눈은 사냥꾼이나 사냥개들이 다가올 수도 있는 육지 쪽으로 향했고요, 반대로 다친 눈은 바다 쪽을 향하게 했지요. 바다로부터는 어떤 위험이 올 거 같지 않았으니까요.
때마침 지나가던 선원 몇몇이 그녀를 발견하곤 성공적으로 조준을 해 암사슴에게 치명적인 상처를 입혔어요.
마지막 숨을 몰아쉬던 암사슴이 헐떡이며 말했어요.
“바보 같으니라고! 육지 쪽만 예방할 생각만 했지, 나를 죽일 위험이 바다로부터 오리라곤 생각도 못했잖아.”

106. 양치기와 바다


106. The Shepherd and the Sea
106. 양치기와 바다 (이솝 우화)
​

A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view to commerce. He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of dates, and set sail. But a very great tempest came on, and the ship being in danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise overboard, and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship. Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, “It is again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet.”
양치기가 해안가 근처에서 양 떼를 돌보며 살고 있었어요.
그러다 무척이나 고요하고 조용한 바다를 보곤 장사를 하며 항해를 할 생각을 먹게 되었죠.
그는 자신의 양 떼를 모두 팔고 뱃짐을 가득 싣곤 항해를 했어요.
그러다 거대한 폭풍우를 만나 배는 가라앉고 뱃짐들은 모두 바다에 빠지고 그도 그냥 간신히 목숨만 구해 빈 배를 얻어 타고 탈출할 수 있었죠.
머지않아 지나가던 누군가가 멈춰서더니 고요한 바다를 쳐다보고 있었어요.
예전 그 양치가가 끼어들며 말했어요.
“저 놈(바다)이 또 뭔가 당기는 모양이지, 잠잠한 척 하는 걸 보니.”

107. 당나귀와 수탉과 사자


107. The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion
107. 당나귀와 수탉과 사자 (이솝 우화)
​

AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion, desperate from hunger, approached the spot. He was about to spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice the Lion, it is said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and the Lion fled away as fast as he could. The Ass, observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock summoned courage to attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose. He had run no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and tore him to pieces.
False confidence often leads into danger.
당나귀와 수탉이 ‘짚을 깐 가축의 겨울 우리’에 있는데, 굶주림에 지친 사자가 들이닫쳤어요.
사자는 다짜고짜 당나귀에게 달려들려 했고, 다급해진 수탉이 고함을 질러댔지요. 수탉의 목소리는 정말이지 사자의 귀에 혐오감 그 자체였어요.
사자가 더는 견디지 못하고 달아났어요.
수탉의 울음에 사자가 끔찍이도 전율하며 도망치는 걸 본 당나귀는 용기가 나서 사자를 뒤쫓아가기 시작했어요.
멀리 가지 않아 사자는 몸을 돌리곤 단번에 당나귀를 덮쳐 갈가리 찢어놓고 말았지요.
근거 자신감은 파멸의 지름길이랍니다.

108. 생쥐들과 족제비들


108. The Mice and the Weasels
108. 생쥐들과 족제비들 (이솝 우화)
​

THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, in which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors. The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions.
족제비들과 생쥐들 사이에 끝장 전쟁이 벌어져 피가 낭자했어요.
그런데 문제는 그 싸움들에서 항상 족제비들이 이겼다는 거지요.
생쥐들은 계속해서 지자 작전회의를 열고 결론을 내렸죠.
“이건 모두 우리들에게 장교들이 없기 때문이야. 병사들에게 명령을 내리는 장교들 말이야. 전술 부족이 우리를 위험에 노출시킨 거라고.”
그리하여 그들은 생쥐의 지도자들을 뽑았어요. 모두 똑똑하고 힘세고 말 잘하고 싸움에 앞장서는 애들로만 뽑았죠. 이제 생쥐들은 백전백승 할 것만 같았답니다, 장교들과 함께라면 말이죠.
​

When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the Weasels.
The more honor the more danger.
장교 선출이 끝이 나고, 군대의 규율을 정한 다음, 장교 생쥐들이 족제비에게 도전장을 다시 내밀었지요.
장교 생쥐들의 머리엔 지푸라기들을 꽂아 군대에서도 더 잘 보이게 조치했답니다.
전투가 벌어지자마자 또 다시 생쥐들이 대패하고 말았어요, 생쥐들은 저마다 자신들의 구멍들 속으로 들어가 버렸죠.
그런데 장교 생쥐들은 자신들의 머리에 쓴 거추장스러운 지푸라기 장식들 때문에 구멍 속으로 들어갈 수가 없었어요, 그 바람에 모두 잡혀서 족제비들에게 잡아먹히고 말았답니다.
특권이 쌜수록 더 위험해지는 거랍니다.

109. 고양이 목에 방울 달기


109. The Mice in Council
109. 고양이 목에 방울 달기 (원래제목→생쥐들은 회의 중)(이솝 우화)
​

THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best devise means of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the Cat. Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling, might run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach. But when the Mice further debated who among them should thus “bell the Cat,” there was no one found to do it.
생쥐들이 자신들의 목숨을 위협하는 엄청난 적인 고양이의 접근을 미리 알 수 있는 방안을 강구하는 회의를 소집했어요.
수많은 계획들이 제출되었고, 그 중 한 안건이 대다수의 찬성을 받았는데, 그건 바로 고양이 목에 방울을 달자는 내용이었어요.
그렇게만 된다면야 딸랑이는 소리를 듣고서 생쥐들이 도망쳐 구멍 속으로 숨을 수 있으니까요.
하지만 회의가 “그럼 누가 고양이 목에 방울을 달 것인가?”로 이어지자 그 많든 생쥐들이 입을 꾹 다물고 말았답니다.

A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went. “The master,” he replied. Then said the Wolf: “May no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of this chain is enough to spoil the appetite.”
목에 개목걸이를 하고서 피둥피둥 살이 찐 ‘마스티프’(불도그처럼 생긴 개. 맹수사냥용으로 사육되는 초대형 사육견)가 마주친 늑대가 “대체 누구 덕에 그렇게 살이 오른 건가? 그리고 그 무거운 목걸이는 또 뭔가?”라고 물었어요.
“우리 주인이야.”라며 마스티프(개)가 대답했어요.

A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called together to consider the best means of protecting it from the enemy. A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an effective resistance. A Carpenter, with equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable method of defense. Upon which a Currier stood up and said, “Sirs, I differ from you altogether: there is no material for resistance equal to a covering of hides; and nothing so good as leather.”

이에 ‘가죽을 다루는 사람’도 일어나더니 말했어요.

The storm still continuing, he was obliged to slaughter his yoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took counsel together, and said, “It is time for us to be off, for if the master spare not his oxen, who work for his gain, how can we expect him to spare us?’

AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden Image, to be placed in one of its Temples. As he passed along, the crowd made lowly prostration before the Image. The Ass, thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for himself, bristled up with pride, gave himself airs, and refused to move another step. The driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his whip lustily about his shoulders and said, “O you perverse dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass.”

A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on the ground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. Shortly afterwards the Bull with his horns gored him as if he were an enemy. When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be assailed with impunity, he let drive at his forehead with his heels. The expiring Lion said, “I have reluctantly brooked the insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a double death.”

A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase. He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His master, quickly coming up, was very much disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The Hound looked up and said, “It was not my fault. master: my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not help my infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am.”
젊은 시절엔 팔팔하고 맹수들도 거침없이 물리치던 사냥개가 어느덧 세월을 먹었어요.
그가 이제 멧돼지를 뒤쫓다 대담무쌍하게도 멧돼지의 귀를 물었지만 오래 물고 있을 수가 없었어요, 남아 있는 이가 하나도 없었기 때문이죠.

121. 벌과 제우스 (이솝 우화)
​

A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to give whatever she should ask. She therefore besought him, saying, “Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if any mortal shall approach to take my honey, I may kill him.” Jupiter was much displeased, for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the request because of his promise. He thus answered the Bee: “You shall have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make, and then you will die from the loss of it.”
Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.
히메투스 산(그리스 동남부, 아테네 동쪽에 있는 높이 1,028미터 산 이름) 꿀벌 떼의 여왕벌이 올림포스 산(그리스 북부. 그리스에서 가장 높은 산 이름. 높이 2,918미터)으로 기어 올라가 제우스 신께 자신의 벌집들에서 생산한 신선한 꿀을 받쳤답니다.
그 선물에 제우스 신이 무척이나 반기셨어요.
그래서 말씀하셨죠.
“네가 원하는 건 뭐든 들어주마.”
그래서 여왕벌이 애원하며 말했답니다.
“부디, 저희에게 벌침을 주세요. 꿀벌을 가져가려고 다가오는 인간들에게 치명상을 입힐 수 있게요.”
이에 제우스 신께서 크게 난처해하셨어요. 그는 인간들을 사랑했거든요, 그렇다고 이왕 들어주기로 한 소원을 안 들어줄 수도 없는 노릇이었죠.
그래서 그는 여왕벌에게 말했어요.
“그래 네 소원을 들어주도록 하마, 다만 그 벌침으로 너희들의 목숨도 위험해지리라. 너희들이 벌침을 쏘면, 벌침은 너희들이 쏜 곳에 남을 것이며, 그 벌침을 잃은 너흰 그 이유로 죽게 되리라.”
나쁜 소원을 빌면 벌 받아요.

122. 우유 짜는 소녀와 들통


122. The Milk-Woman and Her Pail
122. 우유 짜는 소녀와 들통 (이솝 우화)
​

A FARMER’S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing. “The money for which this milk will be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. The eggs, allowing for all mishaps, will produce two hundred and fifty chickens. The chickens will become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that by the end of the year I shall have money enough from my share to buy a new gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head and refuse them every one.” At this moment she tossed her head in unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.
농부의 딸이 우유 들통을 머리에 이고 들판에서 농장으로 향하며 들떠 있었어요.
“이 우유를 내다팔면 돈이 생기지, 그럼 그걸로 적어도 달걀 3백 개는 살 수 있을 거야. 그럼 그 달걀에서 2백 5십 개 정도의 병아리들은 태어날 거고, 그럼 그 병아리들을 키워서 높은 가격으로 시장에 내다팔 수 있을 거야, 그럼 궁극적으로 그 돈으로 연말엔 새 옷을 한 벌 살 정도의 돈은 마련이 될 테지. 그럼 그 드레스를 입고 크리스마스 파티에 가면, 젊은 총각들이 모두들 내게 프러포즈를 하려들 테지. 그럼 난 꼿꼿이 고개를 들고 도도한 척 다 차버릴 거야, 이렇게.”
바로 그때 흥에 겨운 그녀가 고개를 그만 뒤로 확 젖히고 말았어요, 그 바람에 우튜가 든 들통이 땅바닥에 너부러지고 말았답니다. 즉 그녀의 계획이 물거품이 되고만 거죠.

123. 바닷가의 나그네들


123. The Seaside Travelers
123. 바닷가의 나그네들 (이솝 우화)
​

SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the summit of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the distance what they thought was a large ship. They waited in the hope of seeing it enter the harbor, but as the object on which they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind, they found that it could at the most be a small boat, and not a ship. When however it reached the beach, they discovered that it was only a large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions, “We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing to see but a load of wood.”
Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.
해안가를 여행하던 몇몇 나그네들이 높은 절벽 꼭대기로 올라가보았답니다, 바다 너머를 보려고요.
어째 바다 저 멀리서 커다란 배 한 척이 보이지 뭐예요.
그래서 그 배가 항구에 들어오는 광경을 지켜보려는 욕심에 기다렸죠.
하지만 바람에 떠밀려 해안 가까이 온 그 물체는 어째 그냥 작은 보트 같았어요, 배가 아니고 말이죠.
그리고 그 보트가 해변에 도착했을 때 보니 그건 그냥 땔나무 큰 한 묶음에 불가하더지 뭐예요.
기가 찬 나그네들 중 한 명이 친구들을 향해 말했어요.
“기껏 기다렸더니, 웬걸 그냥 나무네.”
현실은 항상 기대만 못하죠.

124. The Brazier and His Dog
124. ‘놋그릇(쇠붙이 그릇)을 만드는 사람’과 그의 개 (이솝 우화)
​

A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his master, and his constant companion. While he hammered away at his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as if he would ask for a share of his meal. His master one day, pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said, “You wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin to eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food. Do you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that none but those who work are entitled to eat?’
‘놋그릇(쇠붙이 그릇)을 만드는 사람’에겐 귀여운 개가 한 마리 있었어요.
주인을 무척이나 따르는 친구 같은 개였죠.
하지만 그 개는 주인이 쇠붙이로 그릇을 만드는 동안엔 자다, 주인이 저녁을 가져와 먹기만 하면 벌떡 일어나 꼬리를 흔들며 먹을 걸 나눠 달라고 조르는 그런 개였지요.
그러던 하루는 주인이 짐짓 화난 듯 행동하며 개에게 몽둥이를 흔들어 보이며 말했어요.
“이 버르장머리 없는 녀석아! 내가 못 때릴 거 같니? 주인이 일하는 동안엔 자빠져 잠만 자더니, 내가 일을 끝내고 뭘 먹기만 하면 깨선 음식을 달라고 꼬리를 흔드는 거니. 노동이 모든 축복의 근원이며, 일하지 않는 자 먹지도 말란 말도 모르니?”

125. 당나귀와 그림자


125. The Ass and His Shadow
125. 당나귀와 그림자 (이솝 우화)
​

A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one, and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the right to the Shadow. The owner maintained that he had let the Ass only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted that he had, with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The quarrel proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass galloped off.
In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.
여행자가 당나귀 한 마리를 빌려 먼 길을 떠났어요.
가다보니 너무 더운 거 있죠, 햇빛이 정말 쨍쨍 내렸거든요.
그래서 여행자가 잠시 쉬려고 멈추곤 열기를 피할 만한 곳을 찾다보니 당나귀 그림자 아래면 괜찮을 거 같았어요.
그런데 그 그림자가 작아 딱 한 사람이 누우면 끝인 거 있죠.
그 바람에 여행자와 당나귀 주인이 서로 그 그림자가 자기 거라 주장하기에 이르렀고, 급기야 그들 사이에 격한 말다툼이 벌어졌지요.
당나귀 주인은 “당나귀가 내 건데 그 그림자도 내 꺼지.”라고 우겼고요, 여행자는 “내가 당나귀를 빌렸으니 이 당나귀의 그림자도 내 거지 않소.”라고 주장했어요.
그러다 말다툼이 주먹다짐으로 변해 두 사람은 뒤엉켜 싸우게 되었고, 그 틈을 타고 당나귀를 총총 걸음으로 도망가 버렸답니다.
그림자 싸움에 엉뚱한 당나귀만 놓친 꼴이죠.

126. 당나귀와 그의 주인들


126. The Ass and His Masters
126. 당나귀와 그의 주인들 (이솝 우화)
​

AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present service and provided with another master. Jupiter, after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master. Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner.
허브(약초. 라벤더와 박하 등등) 판매상이 당나귀에게 밥은 조금만 주고 일은 엄청 시켰어요.
그래서 당나귀는 제우스에게 빌었죠.
“벗어나고 싶어요, 주인 바꿔 주세용~♥”
제우스는 그에게 경고했어요.
“후회할 건데.”
그리하여 당나귀는 이제 타일(기와)를 제조하는 사람에게 팔려가게 되었어요.
곧 당나귀는 벽돌 공장에서 일하는 것이 전 직장보다 훨씬 힘들다는 걸 알곤, 다시 한 번 제우스 신께 자신의 주인을 바꿔 달라 청을 올렸죠.
제우스가 말했어요,
“이번이 마지막이니라.”
그리하여 당나귀는 이제 ‘동물의 털과 기름을 뽑고 가죽을 부드럽게 다루는 일을 하는 사람’에게 팔려가게 되었어요.
​
​
The Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master’s occupation, said, groaning: “It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him.”
이 끔찍한 상황변화에 당나귀가 끙끙 앓으며 말했지요.
“내가 죽은 후 내 가죽을 매질해 부드럽게 만든 다음 팔려는 현재의 주인보단 그래도 밥은 적게 먹고 일은 고되었지만 전 주인이 훨 나았는데. 그냥 처음 주인에게 머문다고 할 걸.”

A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream. It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: “I wonder how you, who are so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong winds.” They replied, “You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you are destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.”
Stoop to conquer.
엄청 큰 참나무 한 그루가 강풍에 그만 뿌리 채 뽑혀 시냇물 위에 꼴까닥 드러눕고 말았어요.
갈대들 사이로 쓰러진 참나무가 말했어요.
“너희들은 그리고 여리고 가냘프면서도 이 강풍에 끄떡없구나.”
갈대들이 대답했어요.
“네가 그 강풍에 맞서려고만 했으니까 그러지. 그 바람에 강풍도 기를 쓰고 널 쓰러뜨린 거 아니니. 반면 우린 미풍에도 고개를 숙일 줄 안단다, 그러니 우리 갈대들에겐 부러지는 일은 없어, 바람도 빗겨가거든.”

A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single small Fish as the result of his day’s labor. The Fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life: “O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to my full size. Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome profit of me.” The Fisherman replied, “I should indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I were to forego my present certain gain.”
그물을 던지며 살아가는 어부가 하루는 자신의 노동의 결과로 자그마한 물고기 한 마리를 건져올렸답니다.
숨을 헐떡이며 그 물고기가 살려 달라 애원하며 말했어요.
“오 나리, 절 놓아주세요, 저처럼 작은 걸 어디 쓰시게요? 전 아직 자르려면 많이 남앗다고요. 이번에 저를 풀어주시면 제가 바다로 돌아가 부자의 식탁에 올릴 만큼 큰 물고기가 되어 다시 나리의 그물에 걸려 큰 수익이 되게 해드릴게요.”
어부가 대꾸했어요.
“가소롭긴, 네가 언제 다시 잡힐 줄 알고 나중을 생각해 널 풀어달란 거니.”

​

A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was. “I will,” said the man, “at once show you the Lion himself.” The Hunter, turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear, replied, “No, thank you. I did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion himself.”
The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.
담력이 썩 있진 못한 어떤 사냥꾼 한 명이 사자의 발자국을 찾고 있었어요.
때마침 숲에 나무 베를 사람이 있기에 가서 “사자의 발자국 흔적 못 보셨소, 아님 사자의 잠자리라고 아시는지?”라고 물어보았지요.
“그래요,”라며 나무꾼이 말했어요. “그거라면 저와 함께 갑시다, 내 직접 사자를 보여드리리다.”
그 말에 얼굴이 새파래진 사냥꾼이 겁에 질러 이빨까지 딱딱 부딪히며 말했어요.
“아뇨, 아닙니다, 형씨. 난 그걸 물은 게 아니오. 내가 찾던 건 발자국이지, 사자가 아니라오.”

The Farmer, beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened the gate and released the Lion. On his departure the Farmer grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took place, said, “On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for a moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only hear his roar at a distance?’

MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held among mortals. For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited in this disguise a Sculptor’s studio having looked at various statues, he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno. When the sum at which they were valued was named, he pointed to a figure of himself, saying to the Sculptor, “You will certainly want much more for this, as it is the statue of the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain.” The Sculptor replied, “Well, if you will buy these, I’ll fling you that into the bargain.”

When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to get him at night, when it was dark, and he was not able to distinguish one bird from the other. By mistake he caught the Swan instead of the Goose. The Swan, threatened with death, burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice, and preserved his life by his melody.

A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen the Fox. He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed, all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay hidden. The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing his word, hastened forward in the chase.

다행히도 사냥꾼은 그 손짓의 의미를 알지 못하고 나무꾼의 말만 믿고 서둘러 딴 곳으로 가버렸어요.
​

As soon as they were well away, the Fox departed without taking any notice of the Woodcutter: whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, “You ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me without a word of thanks.” The Fox replied, “Indeed, I should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your speech.”
사냥꾼들과 개들이 멀리 떠나자마자, 여우가 나오더니 나무꾼에게 고맙다는 인사도 않고 떠나려했어요.
그래서 나무꾼이 여우를 불러 세우곤 나무라며 말했지요.
“이 배은망덕한 놈아, 내가 네 생명을 구해주었거늘, 어찌하여 고맙단 인사 한 번 없는 거냐.”
여우가 대꾸했어요.
“그래요, 말과 행동이 같았고, 당신의 손이 말을 배신하지만 않았어도, 전 고맙단 인사를 백 번 천 번은 더 해드렸을 거예요.”

136. 새사냥꾼과 자고새와 수탉


136. The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock
136. 새사냥꾼과 자고새와 수탉 (이솝 우화)
​

A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a friend unexpectedly came in. The bird-trap was quite empty, as he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which he had tamed for a decoy. The bird entreated earnestly for his life: “What would you do without me when next you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for you the covey of answering birds?’ The Birdcatcher spared his life, and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to his comb.
새사냥꾼이 막 식탁에 앉아 풀뿌리로 저녁식사를 하려는데, 친구 한 명이 예기치 않게 방문을 했지 뭐예요.
새장은 텅 비어있고, 오늘 잡은 새도 없던 터라, 새사냥꾼은 급기야 얼룩 자고새를 죽이기로 결심했죠. 그 새는 다른 새들을 잡을 때 미끼용으로 키운 새였지요.
자고새가 살려달라 애걸복걸하며 말했어요.
”저 없이 다음번 사냥 때 어떻게 그물을 치며 어떻게 다른 새들을 유인하시려고요?“
그래서 새사냥꾼은 자고새를 놓아두고, 결국 젊은 수탉을 잡으러 닭장으로 갔지요.
​

But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: “If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit the bird-trap in the morning?’ He replied, “What you say is true. You are a capital bird at telling the time of day. But my friend and I must have our dinners.”
Necessity knows no law.
하지만 수탉 또한 자신의 횃대(앉는 자리인 나무 막대기)에서 불쌍한 말투도 간청했어요.
“저를 죽이시면 누가 주인님께 새벽을 알려드리며, 아침마다 새덫에 가볼 시간을 알려주고, 매일 깨워드린단 말씀이세요?”
새사냥꾼이 대꾸했어요.
“네 말이 다 옳다. 네가 시간을 알려주는 귀중한 새임엔 틀림없다만, 그렇지만 내 친구와 나도 저녁은 먹어야하지 않겠니.”
목구멍이 포도청(원문→궁핍하면 법을 모르죠).

137. 원숭이와 어부들


137. The Monkey and the Fishermen
137. 원숭이와 어부들 (이솝 우화)
​

A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to dinner left their nets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had done. Having handled the net, he threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and drowned. With his last breath he said to himself, “I am rightly served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to try and catch fish?’
원숭이가 높은 나무 위에 앉아 있다, 몇몇 어부들이 강에 그물을 던지는 것을 보았어요. 신기해서 원숭이는 어부들의 동작을 유심히 보아두었답니다.
잠시 후 어부들이 물고기 잡기를 관두고 그물을 강둑에 내버려둔 채 저녁밥을 먹으러 집으로 갔어요.
원체 호기심이 많은 동물인 원숭이는 냉큼 나무 위에서 내려왔어요, 한번 자신도 따라해볼 생각이었거든요.
그러다 그물을 던진다는 게 그만 자신도 그물에 뒤엉키며 강에 빠지고 말았죠.
그물눈에 뒤엉켜 익사해가던 원숭이가 마지막 숨을 내쉬며 스스로에게 말했어요.
”이래도 싸지. 생전 그물이라곤 만져본 적도 없는 놈이 무슨 물고기를 잡겠다고 에구?“

A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him, causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help. When the Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, “O Hercules! if you will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists?’
벼룩이 어느 레슬링 선수의 맨발 위로 톡 하고 내려앉았어요.
그러자 그 레슬링 선수가 큰 소리로 헤라클레스(힘센 영웅)에게 도움을 청했지요.
벼룩이 그의 발 위에서 두 번째로 폴짝하고 점프하자, 그가 간지러워하며 말했어요.
”오 헤라클레스여! 벼룩 하나도 안 도와주시면서, 무선 큰 적들과 맞설 때 당신의 도움을 바라겠나이까?“

​

TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool. When the pool dried up under the summer’s heat, they left it and set out together for another home. As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with water, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said to the other, “Let us descend and make our abode in this well: it will furnish us with shelter and food.” The other replied with greater caution, “But suppose the water should fail us. How can we get out again from so great a depth?’
Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.
두 마리 개구리가 같은 늪에 살고 있었어요.
근데 늪에 물이 다 마르지 뭐예요, 여름철 더운 기온 때문에 말이죠.
그래서 그들은 거기를 벗어나 다른 집을 찾아나섰답니다.
그러다 운 좋게도 깊은 우물에 도착했지요.
물이 풍부한 우물이었어요.
그걸 보고 있던 한 마리가 친구에게 말했어요.
”우리 내려가서 이 우물에서 살자, 집도 되고 음식도 풍부할 거잖니.“
친구가 신중하게 대꾸했어요.
”그래 네 말대로 물이야 많이 있지. 하지만 저 깊은 곳에서 어떻게 다시 나오겠다는 거니?“

140. 고양이와 생쥐들


140. The Cat and the Mice
140. 고양이와 생쥐들 (이솝 우화)
​

A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, “Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you.”
어떤 집이 생쥐들로 넘쳐나고 있었어요.
소문을 듣고 고양이 한 마리가 냉큼 그 집으로 들어가 살림을 차린 다음 한 마리씩 차례차례 생쥐들을 잡아먹기 시작했어요.
생명의 위협을 느낀 생쥐들은 이제 구멍 속에서 꽁공 숨어만 있었답니다.
더는 생쥐들을 잡아먹을 수 없게 된 고양이가 꾀를 내 생쥐들을 꼬드길 필요성을 느끼곤, 나무 못 위로 뛰어올라가 발로 못을 붙잡고 거꾸로 축 늘어지며 죽은 척 했어요.
말없이 그의 행동을 지켜보고 있던 생쥐들 중 한 마리가 고개를 내밀곤 고양이에게 말했어요.
“아, 고양이 아줌마, 당신이 옥수수자루로 변하더라도 아마 아무도 가까이 가지 않을 걸요.”

141. 사자와 곰과 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely for its possession. When they had fearfully lacerated each other and were faint from the long combat, they lay down exhausted with fatigue. A Fox, who had gone round them at a distance several times, saw them both stretched on the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the middle. He ran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could. The Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said, “Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox.”
It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another all the profit.
사자와 곰이 거의 동시에 새끼염소를 잡는 바람에 곧 서로 자기 거라면 대판 싸우게 되었어요.
격하게 치고받고 하다 곧 둘 다 완전히 지쳐 녹다운이 돼 바닥에 드러눕고 말았죠.
그때 저 멀리서 사자와 곰 주변을 빙빙 몇 차례 돌며 망을 보던 여우가 사자와 곰은 완전히 탈진해 자빠져 있고 그들 사이엔 손도 대지 않은 새끼염소 한 마리가 놓여 있는 걸 보았지요.
여우가 그들 둘 사이를 지나치더니 새끼염소를 손살 같이 낚아채 가버렸어요.
여우가 하는 짓거리를 보고 있던 사자와 곰은 너무 힘이 없어 일어나지도 못하고서 말했지요.
“꼬라지(꼬락서니) 한 번 희한하게 됐네, 우리 둘이 죽어라 다투는 사이 엉뚱한 여우만 이득을 보고 말았군.”

​

A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel, of which the crew and passengers were all drowned. He inveighed against the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to perish. As he was indulging in these reflections, he found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants, near whose nest he was standing. One of them climbed up and stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to death with his foot. Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his wand, said, “And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner treated these poor Ants?’
난파당해 선원들과 승객들이 모두 물에 빠져 죽고 해안가에 너부러져 있는 배 한 척을 철학자가 목격하게 되었어요.
철학자가 신을 통렬히 비난하며 말했어요.
”이것이 신의 섭리인가, 죄를 범한 한 사람이 아니라 우연히 배에 타게 된 수많은 무고한 사람들을 죽이는 게 과연 신의 섭리란 말인가!“

Though the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep outside the hole. The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole. The Bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. At which the Mouse said, “The great do not always prevail. There are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do mischief.”

At last, being very angry, he took his image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall. When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, “Well, I think thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you honor, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am loaded with an abundance of riches.”

The Bull quietly addressed him: “Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a Bull.”

황소가 들어서자마자 동굴에 있던 숫염소가 뿔로 재빨리 들이받았어요.
기가 찬 황소가 나름 차분한 어조로 말했어요.
“뿔 치워. 난 네게 아무른 해코지 할 의도가 없다고, 사자 때문에 도망 온 거야. 하지만 그 야수만 가고 나면 염소가 센지 황소가 힘이 센지 내 기필코 보여주지.”

151. 춤추는 원숭이들


151. The Dancing Monkeys
151. 춤추는 원숭이들 (이솝 우화)
​

A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally great mimics of men’s actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of the courtiers. The spectacle was often repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead of actors. Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.
왕자가 원숭이 몇 마리를 춤을 추게 가르쳤어요.
아시잖아요, 원숭이들이 원체 사람의 행동을 흉내 내길 좋아하는 족속들이라 이런 걸 좋아한다는 걸요.
부자 옷과 가면을 씌어주자 원숭이들은 신이 나서 고위직 신하들을 모두 흉내 내며 춤을 잘도 추었답니다.
어찌나 잘 추는지 구경꾼들이 박수갈채를 보내며 찬탄해마지 않았죠.
그때 하도 그게 눈꼴사납던 고위직 신하 한 명이 짓궂게도 호주머니에 호두를 한 움큼 꺼내 무대에 뿌렸지 뭐예요.
호두를 본 원숭이들은 그만 넋이 나가 자신들이 한 참 춤을 추던 중이었던 것도 잊어버리고 정말로 원숭이들로 돌아와, 쓰고 있던 가면과 옷들을 내던져버리곤 서로 그 호두를 차지하겠다고 자기들끼리 싸우기 바빴죠.
그제야 구경꾼들도 상황파악을 하곤 원숭이들의 볼썽사나운 행동을 비웃기에 바빴답니다.

THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of the two. The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated his skin. But the Fox, interrupting him, said, “And how much more beautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not in body, but in mind.”
누가 더 예쁜가를 두고 여우와 표범이 논쟁을 벌이고 있었어요.
표범은 자신의 가죽에 난 다양한 점들을 보여주며 자신의 미모를 뽐냈죠.

“그래 무늬에 있어선 네가 더 잘났어. 그런데 몸이 아닌 머리는 누가 더 나을까.”

​

THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth. The Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care, but hates and neglects the other. It happened once that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed.
The best intentions will not always ensure success.
흔히들 원숭이들은 한 번에 두 애를 낳는다고 합니다.
그럼 엄마 원숭이는 한 애만 편애하고 엄청 애정을 가득 담아 돌보지만, 다른 애는 싫어하고 무시한다네요.
그럼 엄마로부터 애정과 관심을 듬뿍 받고 자란 원숭이는 숨이 막혀 성장이 더딘데 반해, 방치되고 될대로 자란 원숭이 쪽은 잘 큰다고 합니다.

아 글쎄 참나무들이 들고 일어났지 뭐예요, 누구에게는요 바로 제우스 신에게 말이죠.
참나무들은 이렇게 말했어요.
“저희만 외 삶의 무게를 짊어져야하는데요. 우리가 어른만 되기만 하면 도끼날들이 우릴 찍어내잖아요.”
곧 제우스 신이 대답을 했어요.
“너희들이 자초한 불행이 아니더냐. 너희들이 그렇게 좋은 도끼 자루(도끼의 손잡이 부분)를 만들어주지만 않았어도 목수들이며 농부들이 도끼로 너희의 밑동(뿌리와 가까운 나무줄기 부분)까지 찍는 일은 없었을 것이 아니냐.”

A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well. Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him: “Good Sir, pray wake up: for if you fall into the well, the blame will be thrown on me, and I shall get an ill name among mortals; for I find that men are sure to impute their calamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really brought them on themselves.”
Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.

“이봐요 양반, 일어나셔야죠. 당신이 우물에 떨어지면, 절 비난하실 거잖아요. 그럼 전 인간들 사이에서 또 나쁜 평판을 가지게 될 거고. 왜냐면 사람들은 자신들의 어리석음 탓에 초래된 수많은 재앙들조차도 무조건 제 탓으로 돌리는 버릇이 있으니까요.”

​

THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division.
사자와 여우와 당나귀가 동맹을 맺고 사냥을 나가 많은 사냥감을 잡았어요.
숲에서 돌아온 다음 사자가 우선 당나귀 보고 각자의 몫을 나눠보라 말했어요.
당나귀는 주의 깊게 세 등분을 나눈 다음 다른 두 동물보고 먼저 고르라고 말했지요.
그러자 사자가 큰 역정을 내더니 냉큼 당나귀에게 달려들어 잡아먹어버렸어요.
그런 다음 사자는 여우보고 나눠보라고 말했어요.
​
​
The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, “Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to a fraction.” He replied, “I learned it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate.”
Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.
여우는 그들이 잡은 사냥감을 몽땅 한쪽에 수북이 쌓은 다음 사자의 거라 말하고, 자기 몫으론 한 입 거리만을 남겼어요.
사자가 무척 기특해하며 말했어요.
“내 훌륭한 친구여, 누가 네게 이토록 잘 나누는 법을 가르치더냐? 이건 정말이지 완벽한 분배야.”
여우가 대꾸했어요.
“방금 죽은 당나귀에게서 배웠어요.”

The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day.

A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events. Seeing some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as she could. The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded, when one of them said to his companion, “Let us proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen.”
Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, only make themselves ridiculous.

A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a handle for his axe. The Trees consented to his request and gave him a young ash-tree. No sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it, than he began to use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest. An old oak, lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said to a neighboring cedar, “The first step has lost us all. If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have retained our own privileges and have stood for ages.”
한 남자가 숲에 들어서더니 나무들 보고 “도끼에 달 손잡이 하나만 주세요.”라고 부탁했어요.
그래서 나무들은 선 듯 그의 청을 들어주곤 어린 물푸레나무(사진링크▶ https://goo.gl/7AkKf1 ) 하나를 내주었어요.
그 즉시 남자는 그 물푸레나무로 도끼자루를 만들어내더니, 숲에서도 가장 큰 거인 나무들을 찍어넘기기 시작했지요.
후회해도 이미 늦었을 무렵 늙은 참나무가 옆에 있던 향나무(사진링크▶ https://goo.gl/ypCsLI )에게 말했지요.
“첫 단계부터 잘못했어. 우리 큰 나무들이 작은 물푸레나무의 권리를 포기했을 때 그건 이미 우리 자신의 특권과 지위조차도 포기하겠다는 의미였던 거야.”

마침내 이 목적을 위해 그녀는 자신의 암탉에게 보리를 두 배씩 먹이기 시작했어요.
그날 이후 암탉은 차츰 뚱뚱해지고 번드르르하게 기름지기 시작하더니 체질이 변해 결국 달걀을 한 개도 못 낳게 되고 말았답니다.

169. 당나귀와 늙은 양치기


169. The Ass and the Old Shepherd
169. 당나귀와 늙은 양치기 (이솝 우화)
​

A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all of a sudden by the cries of the enemy. He appealed to the Ass to fly with him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal lazily replied, “Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?’ “No,” rejoined the Shepherd. “Then,” said the Ass, “as long as I carry the panniers, what matters it to me whom I serve?’
In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name of their master.
풀밭에서 풀을 뜯어먹고 있는 자신의 당나귀를 지켜보고 있던 양치기가 적이 쳐들어오며 내지르는 고함소리에 깜짝 놀라고 말았어요.
그가 당나귀보고 “얼른 달아나자, 그러지 않음 사로잡힌다.”라고 말을 했지요.
그랬더니 동물이 느긋하게 대꾸하길 다음과 같았어요.
“제가 왜요? 제가 왜 달아나야하는데요? 저들이 제 등에 짐을 지금의 두 배로 늘릴 것도 아니잖아요?”
“그렇겠지,”라며 양치기가 대답했어요.
“그럼 뭐,”라며 당나귀가 말했어요. “제가 저들에게 붙잡힌다 한들 크게 문제될 게 없지 않겠어요?”
고통 받는 자에겐 주인이 바뀐다고 굳이 문제될 건 없다.

170. 솔개들과 백조들


170. The Kites and the Swans
170. 솔개들과 백조들 (이솝 우화)
​

TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege of song. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.
The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present blessings.
아세요? 옛날엔 솔개들도 백조들과 마찬가지로 울음소리가 독보적이었답니다.
하지만 말의 울음소리를 듣고 매혹된 솔개들이 자꾸 말의 울음소리를 흉내 내려다 결국 가선 정작 어떻게 울어야하는지를 까먹게 된 거예요.
남의 장점만 보고 쫓다 자칫 자신이 지니고 있던 현재의 재능을 잃을 수도 있답니다.

171. The Wolves and the Sheepdogs
171. 늑대들과 ‘양치기 개’들 (이솝 우화)
​

THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs: “Why should you, who are like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us, and live with us as brothers should? We differ from you in one point only. We live in freedom, but you bow down to and slave for men, who in return for your services flog you with whips and put collars on your necks. They make you also guard their sheep, and while they eat the mutton throw only the bones to you. If you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the sheep, and we will enjoy them in common, till we all are surfeited.” The Dogs listened favorably to these proposals, and, entering the den of the Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.
늑대들이 하루는 ‘양치기 개’들에게 이렇게 말했어요.
“응, 왜, 응, 우리가 이리 닮은데, 왜 허구한 날 싸워야 하냐고, 형제들이여? 우리와 너흰 딱 한 가지밖에 다르지 않아. 우린 자유 속에 살고, 너흰 인간들에게 굽신 거리며 노예처럼 살지. 그래서 너희들에게 돌아오는 게 채찍질과 개목걸이 밖에 더 있어. 인간들은 너희보고 양 떼들을 지키라 시키지만 실상은 지들이 먹다 버린 뼈다귀만을 너희들에게 줄 뿐이지. 이제 너희가 우리말을 듣고 양 떼들을 우리에게 넘긴다면, 우린 죽을 때까지 배부르게 먹으며 살 수 있다고.”
이 제안에 귀가 솔깃해진 개들이 늑대들의 소굴로 들어갔다, 그만 늑대들이 한꺼번에 달려드는 통에 개들의 몸은 갈가리 찢겨지고 말았답니다.

​

A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game, but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach. The Lion alone challenged him to combat. The Bowman immediately shot out an arrow and said to the Lion: “I send thee my messenger, that from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I assail thee.” The wounded Lion rushed away in great fear, and when a Fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of good courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied: “You counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how shall I abide the attack of the man himself?’
Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance.
아주 솜씨 좋은 궁수(활을 쏘는 사람)가 산으로 사냥을 나갔답니다.
그러자 숲에 있던 짐승들이 모두 도망을 쳤지요.
하지만 사자만은 당당히 그와 맞장을 떴어요.
궁수는 즉시 화살을 한 방 쏘아 맞추곤 사자에게 말했어요.
”내가 보낸 심부름꾼(화살) 맛이 어떠냐, 거기 가만 있거라 이제 내가 직접 가서 널 때려눕혀주지.“
그 말에 화들짝 놀란 사자가 부상을 당한 몸을 이끌고 황급히 도망을 쳤답니다.
이 모든 광경을 지켜보던 여우가 사자보고 “아니 사자가 달아나시다니요, 어서 돌아가 싸우세요. 용맹을 보여주셔야죠.”라고 말했어요.
그러자 사자가 대꾸했어요.
“말은 잘해. 이런 심부름꾼(화살)을 보낼 정도면 저 자의 직접적인 공격은 어느 정도겠냐?”
강자를 상대할 땐 경계심을 늦추지 말아야 해요. 적당히 먼 거리를 두는 것도 좋겠죠.

WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast size that he ran away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness of the beast’s temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him. Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him.
Use serves to overcome dread.
낙타를 처음 본 사람이 그 엄청난 몸집에 기절초풍한 나머지 달아나고 말았어요.

A HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for some distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog. The Hare said to him, “I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show yourself in your true colors. If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?’
No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust him.

A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very much bruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of hungry blood-sucking flies settled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him. “By no means,” replied the Fox; “pray do not molest them.” “How is this?’ said the Hedgehog; “do you not want to be rid of them?’ “No,” returned the Fox, “for these flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little, and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I have left.”
물살이 센 깊은 계곡물을 헤엄쳐 건넌 여우가 그만 너무 기진맥진해지고 허약해져선 더는 움직이질 못하고 그 자리에 한동안 드러누워 있었답니다.
그러자 피를 빨아먹는 쇠파리들이 여우의 몸 위로 달려들었어요.

181. 독수리와 고양이와 암멧돼지


181. The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow
181. 독수리와 고양이와 암멧돼지 (이솝 우화)
​

AN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the Eagle, and said, “Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too, unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our families as food for her young.”
높은 떡갈나무 꼭대기에 독수리가 둥지를 만들었어요.
그리고 그 나무줄기 중간에 고양이도 편안한 보금자리 구멍을 찾았지요.
암멧돼지 또한 자신의 어린 자녀들과 함께 그 나무의 뿌리부분에 있던 빈 공간에 은신처를 만들었답니다.
자기 빼고 두 집 모두를 파괴할 결심을 교활한 고양이가 했답니다.
결심을 실행에 옮기기 위해, 고양이는 우선 독수리 둥지로 기어올라가 말했어요.
“독수리 아줌마나 나나 이제 끝장이라고. 땅에다 매일같이 흙을 파헤치는 저 암퇘지가 이 떡갈나무가 호시탐탐 거꾸러지길 바라고 있으니까. 아마 자기 새끼들에게 우리들의 가족들을 먹이로 먹이려는 심보인거 같아요.”
​

Having thus frightened the Eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said, “Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs.” Having instilled these fears into the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree.
경악한 독수리는 정신이 나갈 지경이었죠.
그걸 확인한 다음 고양이는 이번엔 암멧돼지의 굴로 내려가 말했어요.
“돼지 아줌마의 자녀들은 이제 위험에 빠졌다고요. 당신이 자녀들과 함께 먹이를 구하러 집을 나서기만 하면, 저 독수리가 내려와 당신의 어린 자녀들을 낚아채갈 준비를 하고 있으니까요.”
이 말에 완전히 넘어가 두려워진 암멧돼지는 나무로 자신의 굴을 가리는데 여념이 없었어요.
​
​
When night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they both, along with their families, perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for the Cat and her kittens.
밤이 되자, 고양이는 몰래 가만가만 나가 자신과 새끼들을 위한 먹이를 구해왔어요. 하지만 고양이는 벌건 대낮에는 두려움에 사로잡힌 양 연기를 했더랬죠.
그러는 사이 독수리는 암멧돼지가 걱정스러워 나뭇가지 위에 앉아만 있었고, 그리고 암멧돼지 또한 독수리가 걱정스러워 감히 자신의 굴을 떠나질 못했답니다.
그리되니 당연히 둘과 그들의 가족 모두 굶어죽게 되었지요.
그들의 시체는 교활한 고양이와 새끼(고양이)들의 풍부한 먹이로 활용되었답니다.

182. 도둑과 여인숙 주인


182. The Thief and the Innkeeper
182. 도둑과 여인숙 주인 (이솝 우화)
​

A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning. When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door. The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him. As the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf.
도둑이 머무는 동안 스리슬쩍 뭔가 값나가는 걸 훔칠 생각으로 여인숙 방을 하나 빌렸어요.
몇 날 그렇게 기회를 노리며 시간을 보내는 동안 아 글쎄 현관 문 앞에 앉아 있는 여인숙 주인의 새 외투가 마음에 드는 거예요.
도둑이 그의 옆에 가 앉으며 말을 걸었어요.
대화가 오고가기 시작하자, 도둑이 지독한 하품을 하더니 마치 늑대처럼 짖는 거예요.
​

The Innkeeper said, “Why do you howl so fearfully?’ “I will tell you,” said the Thief, “but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces. I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually turn into a wolf and attack men.” With this speech he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first. The Innkeeper. hearing his tale and believing what he said, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away.
여인숙 주인이 말했어요.
“왜 그렇게 지독한 하울링(울리는 울음소리)을 하시는 거죠?”
“내 말해드리리다,”라며 도둑이 말했어요. “하지만 그 전에 내 옷들을 좀 들고 있어 주시오, 그렇지 않음 내가 죄다 찢어버리고 말거든요. 이런 하울링(울음소리)을 언제부터 하게 되었는지 또는 내 죄에 대한 무슨 판결인지는 모르겠으나, 내가 이런 하울링을 세 번 하고 나면 아 글쎄 늑대로 돌변해 사람들을 공격하지 뭐요.”
이 말을 하며 그가 두 번째 하울링 발작을 했어요, 꼭 영락없는 늑대처럼 말이죠.
그의 얘기를 다 들은 여인숙 주인은 그 말을 철썩 같이 믿고서 화들짝 놀라하며 급히 자리에서 일어나 달아나려했어요.
​
​
The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying, “Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf.” At the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl. The Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new coat in the Thief’s hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety. The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn.
Every tale is not to be believed.
그새를 놓칠세라 도둑이 여인숙 주인의 외투를 움켜쥐며 “가지 마시구려.”라고 애걸하며 말했어요. “가지 말고 내 옷들이나 좀 들고 있어주시구려, 안 그럼 내 광포함에 옷들이 죄다 찢겨지고 말 테니 말이요, 내가 늑대로 변했을 때요.”
그 순간 그가 세 번째로 늑대의 하울링을 했어요.
기겁을 한 여인숙 주인이 공격을 당하지 않으려고 도둑의 손에 자신의 새 외투를 남겨둔 채 급히 안전한 여인숙 안으로 달려 들어가 버렸어요.
그리하여 도둑은 애초 노렸던 외투를 손에 쥐게 되었고, 당근 그 여인숙에 다시 가지 않았지요.
말이라고 다 믿으면 안 돼요, 날강도들이 많거든요.

183. 노새


183. The Mule
183. 노새 (이솝 우화)
​

A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself: “My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own child in speed and spirit.” On the next day, being driven a long journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone: “I must have made a mistake; my father, after all, could have been only an ass.”
먹을 곡식은 많고 할 일은 거의 없는 뛰놀기 좋아하는 노새가 흥에 겨워 깡충깡충 뛰어다니며 혼잣말을 했어요.
“우리 아빠는 분명 혈기 왕성하신 경주마였을 거야, 아빠의 자녀들 중에서도 속도와 두뇌에 있어 가장 으뜸이 나였을 거고.”
다음날 기나긴 여행길에 끌려가야했던 노새가 완전히 녹초가 되고 풀이 죽어선 투덜거렸어요.
“어제 한 말은 실수였어. 우리 아빤 분명 그냥 평범한 당나귀였을 거야.”

184. 수사슴과 덩굴식물


184. The Hart and the Vine
184. 수사슴과 덩굴식물 (이솝 우화)
​

A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large leaves of a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the place of his concealment. Supposing all danger to have passed, the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves, looked back, and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow from his bow and struck it. The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: “I am rightly served, for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me.”
쫓기던 수사슴이 다급하게 덩굴식물의 큰 잎사귀들 밑으로 몸을 숨겼어요.
사냥꾼들이 서둘다 그만 그 앞을 지나치고 말았죠.
위험에서 벗어났다 생각한 수사슴이 안도하고서 자신을 숨겨준 덩굴식물의 덩굴손(다른 물체에 감기는 부분)들을 조금씩 물어뜯어먹기 시작했어요.
잎사귀들이 바스락거리는 소리에 사냥꾼들 중 한 명이 뒤돌아봤다 수사슴을 발견하곤 바로 화살을 쏘아 관통시켰어요.
숨이 끊어지며 수사슴이 괴로워했어요.
“난 이래도 싸지. 날 구해준 덩굴식물에게 오히려 해코지(해치는 행위)를 했으니까.”

185. 독사와 독수리 (이솝 우화)
​

A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in deadly conflict. The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the bird. A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed the coil of the Serpent and let the Eagle go free. The Serpent, irritated at the escape of his prey, injected his poison into the drinking horn of the countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his danger, was about to drink, when the Eagle struck his hand with his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn in his talons, carried it aloft.
독사와 독수리가 서로 끝장 대결을 펼치고 있었습니다.
곧 독사가 우의를 차지해 새를 둘둘 감고 질식시키기 일보직전이었습니다.
이를 본 시골 농부가 허겁지겁 달려오더니 독사에게 감긴 독수리를 구해 날려 보내주었습니다.
먹이를 놓친 데 발끈한 독사가 그 시골 농부가 마시는 뿔 모양의 잔 속에 자신의 독을 넣었습니다.
전혀 눈치채지 못하고 그 잔을 농부가 막 마시려는데, 아까 그 독수리가 날아와 날개로 농부의 손을 때리곤 발톱으로 잔을 채 하늘 높이 날아가버렸습니다.

​

A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water, flew to it with delight. When he reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it. He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain. At last he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
갈증으로 목이 타들어가던 까마귀가 물주전자를 발견했어요. 그래서 기쁜 마음으로 푸드덕 날아가보았죠.
근데 슬프게도 물주전자 안에 든 물이 너무 작아 그의 부리가 닿질 않는 거예요.
그가 별 짓을 다 해보았지만 모두 헛수고였어요.
마침내 까마귀가 돌멩이를 하나씩 주워와 그 물주전자 안에 떨어뜨렸더니 차차 물이 위로 올라오면서 부리로도 물을 마실 수 있게 되어 타는 갈증을 해결할 수 있었답니다.

187. 두 마리 개구리 (이솝 우화)
​

TWO FROGS were neighbors. One inhabited a deep pond, far removed from public view; the other lived in a gully containing little water, and traversed by a country road. The Frog that lived in the pond warned his friend to change his residence and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that he would enjoy greater safety from danger and more abundant food. The other refused, saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a place to which he had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a heavy wagon passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its wheels.
A willful man will have his way to his own hurt.
두 마리 개구리는 서로 이웃이었어요.

연못에서 맘 놓고 사는 개구리는 항시 도랑에 사는 개구리에게 “어서 주거지를 옮겨, 차라리 우리 집 근처와 살아. 여긴 위험에서도 안전하고 무엇보다 먹이도 풍부하거든.”라고 간절히 걱정해주었죠.
하지만 도랑에 사는 개구리는 거절하며 말했죠.
“지금까지 살아온 정든 곳을 굳이 떠날 마음이 안 생겨서.”
며칠 후 무거운 마차가 그 도랑을 지나가는 바람에 도랑에 살고 있던 개구리가 바퀴에 깔려 몸이 으깨져 죽고 말았답니다.
친구 말을 들었어야죠, 외고집이 화를 부른 거랍니다.

188. 늑대와 여우


188. The Wolf and the Fox
188. 늑대와 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the wolves, who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and swiftness, so that they unanimously decided to call him “Lion.” The Wolf, with a lack of sense proportioned to his enormous size, thought that they gave him this name in earnest, and, leaving his own race, consorted exclusively with the lions. An old sly Fox, seeing this, said, “May I never make myself so ridiculous as you do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though you have the size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are definitely a wolf.”
옛날에 엄청 크고 힘센 늑대 한 마리가 늑대 무리들 속에서 태어났어요. 그는 정말이지 힘과 몸집 그리고 재빠름에 있어서 다른 늑대 친구들을 압도했어요.
그래서 늑대들은 만장일치로 그를 “사자”라고 부르기로 결정했어요.
근데 그 늑대는 거대한 몸집에 비해 센스가 정말 깡이었어요. 그래서 그는 자신에게 사자라는 칭호를 준 무리를 떠나 급기야 진짜 사자들과만 어울리려고 들었죠.
그 꼴을 보다 못한 영악한 여우 영감이 말했어요.
“자네가 가지고 있는 긍지와 자신감을 내 뭐라 하는 바는 아니네, 하지만 자네가 몸집에 있어서 늑대들 사이에서나 사자지, 사자들 무리에 있으면 그냥 늑대에 지나지 않는다고.”

190. 모기와 사자 (이솝 우화)
​

A GNAT came and said to a Lion, “I do not in the least fear you, nor are you stronger than I am. For in what does your strength consist? You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth an a woman in her quarrels. I repeat that I am altogether more powerful than you; and if you doubt it, let us fight and see who will conquer.” The Gnat, having sounded his horn, fastened himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts of the face devoid of hair.
얼씨구, 모기가 날아오더니 사자보고 대뜸 이렇게 말하는 거예요.
“난 네가 두렵지 않아. 힘도 겁나지 않는다고. 그 힘 어디다 쓰려고? 기껏 싸울 때 발톱으로 할퀴고 이빨로 물기나 하겠지. 다시 말하지만 난 너보다 더 강하다고. 못 믿겠으면, 어디 나랑 한 판 뜰까.”
모기는 자신의 뿔피리를 불고선, 힘차게 사자에게로 돌진하더니 사자의 콧구멍과 얼굴 부위 즉 털이 없는 곳들을 마구 물었어요.
​

While trying to crush him, the Lion tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in a song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. He greatly lamented his fate, saying, “Woe is me! that I, who can wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish myself from this spider, the most inconsiderable of insects!”
모기를 뭉갤 작정으로 사자가 자신의 발톱들로 얼굴을 때렸다가 심각한 상처만 입고 말았어요.
이로써 모기가 사자를 이긴 거지요.
“윙윙!!” 모기는 승리의 노래를 부르며 날아갔답니다.
그런데 곧바로 그만 모기는 거미집에 걸려 거미에게 잡아먹히고 말았어요.
모기가 자신의 죽음을 크게 한탄해하며 말했어요.
“아, 슬프도다! 용맹한 사자도 때려눕힌 내가 기껏 하찮은 거미 같은 곤충한테 당하다니!”

191. 원숭이와 돌고래


191. The Monkey and the Dolphin
191. 원숭이와 돌고래 (이솝 우화)
​

A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore.
긴 항해에 나선 어느 뱃사람이 배에 있는 동안 재미나게 지내려고 원숭이를 데리고 갔답니다.
한국(원문→그리스) 항구를 떠났던 그는 그만 큰 폭풍우를 만나 배가 산산조각 나고 그와 원숭이 그리고 모든 선원들이 바다로 뛰어들어 제 살길을 찾아 헤엄쳐야했지요.
파도에 넘실대고 있던 원숭이를 본 돌고래는 그게 사람인줄 알았어요, 왜냐면 돌고래들은 흔히 사람과 친구가 되고 싶어 하니까요, 그래서 돌고래가 다가가 그 원숭이를 등에 태우곤 안전하게 해안가로 향했어요.
​

When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.
서울(원문→아테네. 그리스의 수도)에서 그리 멀지 않은 해안선이 보일 때쯤, 돌고래가 “그럼 넌 ‘서울 사람’(원문→아테네 사람)이겠네?”라고 원숭이에게 물었어요.
원숭이는 그 말이 그 도시에서 가장 유명한 가문들 중 하나를 말하는 줄 알고 “응”이라며 대꾸했어요.
그러자 돌고래가 “그럼 인천(원문→피레우스. 아테네 수도권 지역에 있는 항구도시 이름)도 알겠네?”라고 물었죠.
그게 사람이름일 거라 생각한 원숭이는 “응, 잘 알지, 그와 난 절친(친한 친구) 인걸.”라고 말했어요.
이 말 같지도 않은 거짓말에 발끈한 돌고래는 원숭이를 태운 채 그냥 물속으로 가라앉아버렸고, 그 바람에 원숭이는 익사하고 말았답니다.

​

A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to their cote. But when one day he forgot himself and began to chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth, pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food among the Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing him on account of his color. expelled him from living with them. So desiring two ends, he obtained neither.
갈까마귀(작은 까마귀. 사진링크 ▶ https://goo.gl/VNMEsq )가 보고 있자니, 비둘기들이 먹이를 잔뜩 제공받으며 배부르게 먹고 있는 게 아니겠어요.
그래서 갈까마귀는 자신도 흰색으로 색칠하곤 편히 살 생각으로 비둘기들 틈에 끼어들었죠.
그가 입다물고 있는 동안엔 다른 비둘기들도 그를 자신들과 같은 비둘기들 중 한 명으로 여기고 같이 밥을 먹는 걸 허용했죠.
하지만 하루가 지나자 벌써 갈까마귀는 자신의 신분을 망각하고 재잘거리기 시작했고, 그 바람에 다른 비둘기들이 단번에 그의 정체를 파악하고 내쫓아버렸죠. 그것도 부리로 마구 쪼아대면서 쫓아버렸답니다.
비둘기들에게 호되게 당하고서 갈까마귀 무리에게로 돌아온 그는 색칠한 흰색 때문에 이번엔 갈까마귀 무리들에게서도 친구로 받아들이지 못하고 내쫓기고 말았답니다.
두 개를 다 거머쥐려다 가는 하나도 못 가지는 법이에요.

​

AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself. Then a Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture. The Horse, desiring to revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he were willing to help him in punishing the Stag. The man replied that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him, he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag. The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him. From that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag, he had enslaved himself to the service of man.
옛날에 말이 혼자서 넓은 땅을 독차지하고 있었어요.
그때 수사슴이 들어서더니 자신도 풀을 좀 뜯어먹자는 거예요.
이 낯선 침입자를 쫓아낼 목적으로 말은 인간을 찾아가 “수사슴을 쫓아내는 걸 도와주시겠어요?”라고 물어보았어요.
사람이 대뜸 말했어요.
“네 입에 재갈을 물리고 나를 네 등에 태워만 준다면야 그럼 효율적으로 수사슴을 내쫓을 수 있을 게다.”
말이 동의하고 사람이 자신의 등에 타는 걸 허락해주었어요.

Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said: “I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to which I may dance.” The Wolf complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the Kid, he said, “It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have turned piper to please you.”
새끼염소가 풀밭에서 목동 없이 집으로 돌아가다 그만 늑대에게 쫓기고 말았어요.
아무래도 달아날 방법이 없다 여긴 새끼염소가 몸을 돌려 늑대보고 말했어요.

He sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he could run. A neighbor saw him running and said, “Oh! you fellow there! you say you can foretell the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?’

A HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought shelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly, lighted a fire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with his oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with meat from his own table. Grateful for these favors, the animals determined to repay him to the best of their ability. For this purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly characterized himself.
말과 황소와 개가 추위에 생고생을 하다 가까스로 인간의 집으로 찾아와 안식처와 보호를 요청했어요.
사람은 그들을 상냥하게 맞이해주고, 난로도 피워 그들이 몸을 덥힐 수 있게 해주었어요.
사람은 말에겐 귀리(벼와 비슷하게 생김. 사진링크 ▶ https://goo.gl/MmMQSJ )를 푸짐하게 주었고, 황소에겐 말린 풀을 양껏 주었고, 개에겐 자신(사람)의 식탁에서 고기를 떼어 주었어요.
이 호의에 감동한 동물들이 떠나며 보답으로 사람에게 동물 자신들의 재능들 중 최선의 것을 부여해주었어요.
이를 위해, 동물들은 사람의 생애를 삼등분하여 각자 동물 자신의 특출한 주요 재능을 한 부분씩 부여해주었지요.
​
​
The Horse chose his earliest years and gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.
말은 사람의 초기 생애를 맡았어요. 그래서 말에게서 특질을 부여받은 사람은 누구든 어릴 적에 충동적이고 방자하고 자기 뜻대로 하려는 고집을 피우게 된 거랍니다.
사람의 생애 중간 부분을 떠맡게 된 소 덕분에, 중년의 사람은 일하는 걸 좋아하고 노동에 헌신하며 재산을 모으는 재미를 들인 중년 남편이 되게 되었답니다.
사람의 생애 말년을 떠맡게 된 개 덕분에, 노년의 사람은 종종 성마르고 애태우며 쉽게 만족하지 못하고 자기 위주이고 자신을 돌봐주는 가족 외의 낯선 이들을 질색하게 되는 거랍니다.

199. 원숭이들과 두 여행자


199. The Apes and the Two Travelers
199. 원숭이들과 두 여행자 (이솝 우화)
​

TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told nothing but lies, were traveling together and by chance came to the land of Apes. One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be king, commanded them to be seized and brought before him, that he might know what was said of him among men. He ordered at the same time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his right hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed for him, as was the custom among men. After these preparations he signified that the two men should be brought before him, and greeted them with this salutation: “What sort of a king do I seem to you to be, O strangers?’
두 사나이가 함께 여행을 떠났다 우연히도 원숭이들의 나라에 도착하게 되었어요.
그들 두 사나이들 중 한 명은 절대 진실만을 말하는 자였고, 다른 사람은 절대 거짓만을 말하는 남자였지요.
원숭이들의 왕이 자신을 한껏 뽐내고 싶어 두 남자를 자기 앞에 대려오라 했어요. 그들이 자신(원숭이 왕)을 어떻게 평하는지 듣고 싶었기 때문이지요.
원숭이 왕은 또한 자신의 모든 원숭이들을 자기 오른쪽과 왼쪽에 각각 길게 줄지어 늘어서게 해 위엄을 한 껏 갖추게 하곤 자신의 머리에 왕관도 썼답니다. 인간 세계의 왕처럼요.
모든 준비가 갖추어지자 원숭이 왕은 두 남자를 자기 앞에 데려오게 해 다음과 같은 인사말을 건넸답니다.
“그래 너희 이방인(손님)들이 봤을 때 나는 어떤 왕인고?”
​

The Lying Traveler replied, “You seem to me a most mighty king.” “And what is your estimate of those you see around me?’ “These,” he made answer, “are worthy companions of yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and leaders of armies.” The Ape and all his court, gratified with the lie, commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer. On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, “If so great a reward be given for a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded, if, according to my custom, I tell the truth?’
거짓말만 할 수 있는 여행자가 대꾸했어요.
“전능한 절대군주님 같습니다.”
“그럼 내 신하들은 어떤고?”
“모두들,”라며 그가 대답했어요. “당신을 보필하기에 손색이 없는 대표들이며 군대의 지도자들 같습니다.”
이 거짓말에 궁정에 있던 모든 원숭이들이 한껏 기뻐 아첨에 대한 상을 듬뿍 내주었답니다.
이제 진실만을 말할 수 있는 여행자 차례가 되어, 그가 속으로 생각했어요.
‘거짓말을 하고도 이렇게 많은 상을 받았다면, 그럼 내가 진실을 말해주면 더 큰 상을 받을 거잖아?’
​
​
The Ape quickly turned to him. “And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?’ “Thou art,” he said, “a most excellent Ape, and all these thy companions after thy example are excellent Apes too.” The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave him over to the teeth and claws of his companions.
원숭이 왕이 그에게 몸을 돌리며 말했어요.
“그래 자네가 보기에 나와 내 신하들이 어때 보이는가?”
“당신은,”라며 그가 말했어요. “영락없는 원숭이고, 다른 신하들 또한 영락없는 원숭이들입니다요.”
이 참말에 원숭이 왕이 대노해하며 그에게 원숭이들의 이빨과 발톱으로 모질게 할퀴어지는 벌을 내린 다음 내쫓아버렸답니다.

200. 늑대와 양치기


200. The Wolf and the Shepherd
200. 늑대와 양치기 (이솝 우화)
​

A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over his movements. But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock. When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed: “I have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?’
늑대가 오랫동안 양떼를 따라다니며 아무런 해코지도 하지 않았어요.
양치기도 처음엔 경계심을 늦추지 않았지만, 늑대가 매일같이 양떼와 어울리며 별 짓을 안 하는 거 같자, 양치기도 차츰 경계심을 늦추기 시작했지요.
그러다 한 번은 양치가가 도시로 갈 일이 생기자, 양떼들의 안전을 늑대에게 맡기고 갔어요.
기회를 잡은 늑대가 양떼들을 습격해 엄청난 수의 양들을 죽여 버렸어요.
자신이 돌아왔을 때 이 처참한 광경의 결과물을 보게 된 양치기가 탄식하며 말했어요.
“난 이래도 싸. 고양이(늑대)에게 생선(양떼)을 맡기다니?”

THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should be equal. The Lions made this reply: “Your words, O Hares! are good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have.”
산토끼들이 모여 “모든 동물들은 평등해야한다”며 열변을 토하고 있었어요.
가만히 듣고만 있던 사자들이 대꾸했지요.
“말은 잘해, 산토끼들! 그치만 너희들은 우리들이 가진 발톱과 이빨이 없잖니.”

202. 종달새와 어린 자녀들(새끼종달새들)


202. The Lark and Her Young Ones
202. 종달새와 어린 자녀들(새끼종달새들) (이솝 우화)
​

A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the owner of the field, looking over his ripe crop, said, “The time has come when I must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest.” One of the young Larks heard his speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what place they should move for safety. “There is no occasion to move yet, my son,” she replied; “the man who only sends to his friends to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest.”
이른 봄 종달새가 아직 어리고 푸른 밀밭에 둥지를 틀었어요.
아기종달새들이 아직 완전한 힘과 날개 그리고 풍성한 깃털을 가지기 전에, 밀밭의 주인이 익은 밀밭을 둘러보더니 말했어요.
“수확할 시가가 됐구먼, 내일은 이웃들보고 와서 좀 도와 달래야겠다.”
아기종달새들 중 하나가 이 소리를 듣고 엄마보고 말했어요.
“엄마, 우리 어서 안전한 곳으로 이사 가요.”
“아직 시간이 좀 있단다, 얘야.”라며 엄마종달새가 대답했어요. “친구보고 와 달라 말한다고 한 걸로 봐선 아직 그가 실제 수확할 의지가 없어 보이거든.”
​
​
The owner of the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of ripeness. He said, “I will come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.” The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, “It is time now to be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself.”
Self-help is the best help.
며칠 후 그 주인이 다시 오더니 밀이 다 익어 고개를 아래로 축 떨구고 있는 걸 보곤 말했어요.
“안되겠다, 내일은 일꾼들을 고용해서 내 손으로 직접 수확을 시작해야겠다.”
이 말을 전해들은 엄마종달새가 아기종달새들에게 말했어요.
“이곳을 떠나야할 때가 왔구나, 얘들아, 그가 친구 대신 직접 수확에 나서겠다 한 걸 봐선 말이다.”
뭐든 자기 손으로 하는 게 최고죠.

203. 여우와 사자 (이솝 우화)
​

WHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by chance for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened that he nearly died with fear. On meeting him for the second time, he was still much alarmed, but not to the same extent as at first. On seeing him the third time, he so increased in boldness that he went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with him.
Acquaintance softens prejudices.
사자를 한 번도 본 적이 없는 여우가 우연히도 사자와 맞닥트리곤 하도 기겁을 한 나머지 하마터면 기절해 죽을 뻔했어요.
두 번째 마주쳤을 때도 간이 덜컹하긴 했지만 그래도 처음보단 덜했어요.
세 번째 마주쳤을 때서야 여우도 보다 대담해져 사자를 향해 고개를 쳐들고서 일상대화를 나눌 수 있었답니다.
편견을 깨우치는 데는 익숙해지는 것만 한 게 없지요.

204. 족제비와 생쥐들


204. The Weasel and the Mice
204. 족제비와 생쥐들 (이솝 우화)
​

A WEASEL, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to catch mice as he once did. He therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down in a dark corner. A Mouse, supposing him to be food, leaped upon him, and was instantly caught and squeezed to death. Another perished in a similar manner, and then a third, and still others after them. A very old Mouse, who had escaped many a trap and snare, observed from a safe distance the trick of his crafty foe and said, “Ah! you that lie there, may you prosper just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be!”
나이와 병약함 탓에 무기력해진 족제비가 더는 예전처럼 생쥐를 잡을 수가 없게 되었지 뭐예요.
그래서 족제비는 밀가루 속에 몇 번 구르곤 어두운 구석탱이에 드러누웠죠.
족제비를 먹이로 착각한 생쥐 한 마리가 덥석 달려들었다 곧바로 족제비에게 붙잡혀 저승길로 가고 말았어요.
똑같은 방법으로 또 다른 생쥐 한 마리도 사망하기에 이르렀고, 그렇게 세 번째 생쥐와 또 다른 생쥐들이 차례대로 운명했어요.
지금껏 살아오며 숱한 덫과 함정들을 헤쳐 나왔던 아주 나이 많은 할아버지 생쥐만은 먹잇감을 앞에 두고도 안전한 거리를 확보하고 주의 깊게 살피는 습관이 몸에 베였기에 이 교활한 악당의 속임수를 간파해내곤 이렇게 말할 수 있었어요.
“아! 거기 있는 너, 네가 그 짓거리로 어린 생쥐들을 잘도 잡아먹었을지 몰라도 난 어림없다!”

A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He called out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his imprudence. “Oh, sir!” cried the youth, “pray help me now and scold me afterwards.”
Counsel without help is useless.
강에서 목욕하던 소년이 그만 물에 빠져 익사하기 직전이었어요.

“아, 제발!”라며 소년이 외쳐댔어요. “저부터 일단 구한 다음에 잔소리를 하시라고요.”

206. 당나귀와 늑대 (이솝 우화)
​

AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him, and immediately pretended to be lame. The Wolf, coming up, inquired the cause of his lameness. The Ass replied that passing through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn. He requested that the Wolf pull it out, lest when he ate him it should injure his throat. The Wolf consented and lifted up the foot, and was giving his whole mind to the discovery of the thorn, when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his mouth and galloped away. The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled, said, “I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?’
풀밭에서 풀을 뜯어먹고 있던 당나귀가 자신(당나귀)을 잡으러 다가오고 있는 늑대를 발견하곤 즉시 다리를 절뚝거리는 척 연기했어요.
다가온 늑대가 “왜 그리 절뚝거리느냐?”고 그 이유를 물었어요.
당나귀가 대답했어요.
“산울타리를 넘다 날카로운 가시나무에 발을 헛디뎌서 그래.”
그러면서 당나귀는 “이 가시를 네가 좀 빼줄래. 어차피 나를 잡아먹을 텐데 그랬다가 이 가시가 네 목에 상처를 낼 수 있잖니.”라고 말했어요.
늑대도 선 듯 동의했어요.
“그럼 네 다리를 들어 올려봐.”
늑대는 온 신경을 기울이며 그 가시를 찾느라 여념이 없었어요.
바로 그때 당나귀가 자신의 뒷발을 들더니 그대로 늑대의 입에 있는 이빨들을 걷어차 버리곤 도망쳐버렸어요.
끔찍이도 상처를 당한 늑대가 말했어요.
“난 이래도 싸지. 다른 동물들을 잡아먹으면서 살아가는 놈이 무슨 복을 더 누리겠다고 의사 흉내를 낸 거냐고?”

207. 나무조각상 판매상 (이솝 우화)
​

A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for sale. When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to attract purchasers, he cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches. One of the bystanders said to him, “My good fellow, why do you sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to give?’ “Why,” he replied, “I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good gifts very slowly.”
어떤 사람이 헤르메스(목동과 도둑과 상업의 신. 신들의 심부름꾼 신. 그리스신화) 신의 나무조각상을 만들어 시장에 내다팔고 있었어요.
그런데 아무도 거들떠도 안 보는 거예요, 그래서 하나도 팔 수 없었죠.
그래서 남자는 고함을 지르며 “이 조각상만 사면 복이 우수수 들어옵니다. 돈도 많이 벌 수 있다고요.”라며 자랑을 해댔어요.
그러자 지나가던 구경꾼 하나가 말했어요.
“그렇담, 이보쇼, 그걸 팔게 아니라 당신이 그냥 다 가지고 있음 되는 거 아니요, 그럼 복이며 돈들이 죄다 당신 꺼가 될 텐데?”

​

THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale pleased every ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him. The Goddess, to console him, said, “But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage.” “But for what purpose have I,” said the bird, “this dumb beauty so long as I am surpassed in song?’ “The lot of each,” replied Juno, “has been assigned by the will of the Fates — to thee, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable, and to the crow, unfavorable auguries. These are all contented with the endowments allotted to them.”
공작새가 헤라 여신(제우스신의 아내)을 찾아가 불평을 했어요.
“나이팅게일은 모두의 귀를 즐겁게 하는 목소리를 지녔는데, 왜 저는 입만 열면 사람들이 웃어대냐고요.”
여신이 달래는 말투로 말했어요.
“하지만 넌 미와 몸집에 있어 탁월하잖니. 네 목에 난 에메랄드 빛깔과 네 펼쳐진 꼬리에서 보이는 다채롭고 아름다운 색상들은 또 어떻고.”
“하지만 그게 다 무슨 소용이냐고요,”라며 새가 말했어요. “목소리가 이리 후진데 아둔한 아름다움을 지닌 게 뭐가 대수냐고요?”
“저마다 운명의 여신한테서,”라며 헤라 여신이 대답했어요. “받은 재능이란 게 있는 법이란다. 그녀는 너에겐 아름다움을, 독수리에겐 힘을, 나이팅게일에겐 목소리를, 갈까마귀(작은 몸집의 까마귀)에겐 좋은 예언을, 그리고 까마귀들에겐 나쁜 예언을 주었단다. 그러니 모두들 저마다의 재능에 만족하며 사는 거란다.”

A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped down and seized him. The Nightingale, about to lose his life, earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go, saying that he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted food, ought to pursue the larger birds. The Hawk, interrupting him, said: “I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight.”

212. 개와 수탉과 여우


212. The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox
212. 개와 수탉과 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood. The Cock flying up, perched himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk. When the morning dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times. A Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, came and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a voice. The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said: “Sir, I wish you would do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me, and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let you in.” When the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang out and caught him, and tore him to pieces.
개와 수탉이 친구가 되어 함께 여행을 떠났답니다.
밤이 되자 그들은 울창한 나무속에 잠잘 곳을 마련했어요.
수탉은 날아올라 나무꼭대기에 있던 나뭇가지들 위에 걸터앉았고요, 개는 나무 아래의 속이 빈 나무줄기 속에 잠자리를 마련했어요.
새벽이 밝아오자, 수탉은 평소와 같이 수차례 큰 소리로 “꼬끼오”라고 울어댔어요.
그 소리를 들은 여우가 수탉을 아침식사로 잡아먹으러 나뭇가지 아래로 와 말했어요.
“그런 유창한 목소리를 가진 너와 친구가 되고 싶어.”
그럴 리 없다는 걸 잘 아는 수탉이 말했어요.
“그럼 제 밑에 있는 속이 빈 나무줄기에 있는 문을 열어 제 문지기를 깨어보세요, 그가 당신께 여기로 들어오는 문을 열어줄 거예요.”
여우가 나무로 다가가니 개가 덥석 튀어나오더니 여우를 한 입에 물어뜯어버렸어요.

213. 늑대와 염소


213. The Wolf and the Goat
213. 늑대와 염소 (이솝 우화)
​

A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice, where he had no chance of reaching her. He called to her and earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by some mishap; and he added that the meadows lay where he was standing, and that the herbage was most tender. She replied, “No, my friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but for yourself, who are in want of food.”
가파른 절벽 꼭대기에서 풀을 뜯어먹고 있는 염소 한 마리를 늑대가 발견했는데 도무지 거기까지 올라갈 방법이 없지 뭐예요.
그래서 늑대는 염소를 소리쳐 부르며 아래로 내려오라 간청했지요.
“그러다 떨어지면 어쩌려고 그러니. 이 아래 풀들을 좀 보렴, 얼마나 싱싱하니 씹기 쉬워 보이니.”
염소가 대꾸했어요.
“아뇨, 아저씨, 지금 그 풀 때문에 저보고 내려오라고 하시는 게 아니잖아요, 당신 배 채우려고 그러는 걸 제가 모를 줄 아세요.”

214. 사자와 황소


214. The Lion and the Bull
214. 사자와 황소 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to attack him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to ensure his destruction. He approached the Bull and said, “I have slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have your company.” The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull was in the act of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage, and make his meal on him.
황소를 잡아먹곤 싶은데 덩치가 너무 커 대려 공격을 당할까 걱정이 된 사자가 머리를 굴렸어요.
그래서 황소에게 슬쩍 접근해 이렇게 말했지요.
“방금 막 맛있는 양을 한 마리 잡았는데 말이야, 친구, 어째 우리 집에 가서 같이 먹지 않으련. 너랑 함께 식사를 할 수 있다면 기쁠 거 같아서야.”
사자가 이리 말하니 황소도 은근 양고기가 먹고 싶지 뭐예요.
하지만 사자의 속셈은 기회를 보아 황소를 잡아먹을 심산이었지요.
​
​
The Bull, on approaching the Lion’s den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his departure. The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without a word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause for offense. “I have reasons enough,” said the Bull. “I see no indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull.”
그렇게 사자의 굴로 가까이 가던 황소의 눈에 아 글쎄 양은 온데간데없고 고기 굽는 거대한 쇠꼬챙이와 엄청 큰 가마솥만 보이지 뭐예요.
두 말할 필요도 없이 사뿐히 뒤돌아서 잽싸게 튀었죠.
“인사도 없이 왜 그렇게 가는 거야, 응?”라며 사자가 물었어요. 왜냐면 사자는 미쳐 황소를 공격할 틈새를 잡지 못했거든요.
“이유야 차고 넘치지,”라며 황소가 말했어요. “잡았다는 양은 보이지 않고, 네가 황소를 저녁식사 거리로 잡으려고 왕창 준비해놓은 건만 보이니 그러지.”

215. 염소와 당나귀


215. The Goat and the Ass
215. 염소와 당나귀 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass. The Goat, envying the Ass on account of his greater abundance of food, said, “How shamefully you are treated: at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy burdens”; and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest. The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice. He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat. They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.
옛날에 어느 사람이 염소와 당나귀를 한 마리씩 키우고 있었어요.
그런데 주인이 당나귀에게만 맛난 음식을 잔뜩 주는 게 염소는 못내 질투나 말했어요.
“넌 이렇게 혹사 당하는 게 부끄럽지도 않니, 맨날 맷돌을 돌려야하고 무거운 짐들도 네가 다 날라야하잖니.”
그러면서 염소는 조언하길,
“그러지 말고 한 번 날을 잡아 미친척하고 도랑 속에 빠져봐, 그럼 쭉 휴식을 취할 수 있을 거야.”
그 말에 귀가 솔깃해진 당나귀는 정말로 도랑 속으로 굴러 넘어졌고 그 과정에서 크게 멍이 들고 말았지요.
주인이 의사를 불러 진찰을 구했더니, 의사가 말하길, “이 상처엔 염소의 폐 요리가 와따(최고)입니다.”라고 했어요.
주인과 의사는 그 즉시 염소를 죽였고, 그래서 당나귀는 치료받을 수 있었답니다.

216. 도시 쥐와 시골 쥐


216. The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse
216. 도시 쥐와 시골 쥐 (이솝 우화)
​

A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare plowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the hedgerow, the Town Mouse said to his friend, “You live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my dainties.” The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend.
시골 쥐가 하루는 도시 쥐를 초대했어요. 친한 친구에게 시골 밥상을 먹어보게 해주고 싶어서요.
도시 쥐가 와서 보니 메마른 논밭에서 그냥 밀 줄기와 뿌리를 캐내 내놓은 밥상일 뿐이었어요.
도시 쥐가 친구에게 말했어요.
“참 개미처럼 산다 너, 내 집엔 진수성찬이 가득하고 모든 게 빛까번쩍하지. 나랑 가보자 그럼 내가 얼마나 고상하게 먹는지를 보여줄게.”
시골 쥐가 그 말을 옳게 듣고 친구를 따라 도시로 가보았답니다.
​

On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing.
도착하자 도시 쥐는 친구 앞에 빵이며 보리며 콩이며 마른 무화과 열매며 꿀이며 건포도며 이것저것 바구니에 잔뜩 든 최고급 치즈까지 죄다 내놓았지요.
생전 처음 보는 광경에 뻑이 간 시골 쥐는 너무 들뜬 나머지 “이런 따뜻한 환대는 처음이야, 이에 비하면 내 가혹한 시골 생활은 아쉬워.”라며 한탄을 내어놓았지요.
그들이 막 먹으려는데 “덜컹!”하고 문이 열리더니 누가 들어오는 바람에, 두 생쥐는 화들짝 놀라 죽기 살기로 구멍 속으로 뛰어 들어가야 했답니다. 그 구멍은 두 명의 쥐가 들어가기엔 너무도 비좁은 곳이었지요.
​
​
They had scarcely begun their repast again when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard, whereupon the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, said to his friend: “Although you have prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me. I prefer my bare plowlands and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in safety, and without fear.”
그들이 간신히 여유를 차리고 다시 한 입 먹으려 하는데 이번엔 또 다른 사람이 찬장에서 뭔가를 꺼내가려고 들어오는 바람에, 두 생쥐는 정말이지 전보다 더 놀란 나머지 달아나 몸을 숨겨야했답니다.
마침내 그런 식의 일들이 계속되자 음식을 앞에 놓고도 배를 쫄쫄 굶은 시골 쥐가 친구한테 말했어요.
“나를 위해 진수성찬을 내놓은 건 알겠는데, 그만 가 봐야겠다, 친구야. 이렇게 많은 위험들에 둘러싸인 상태로 도저히 음식이 입에 넘어가질 않거든. 난 메마른 논밭에서 풀뿌리로 살아가더라도 겁 먹지 않고 마음 편히 살아가는 게 더 좋거든.”

A WOLF accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the charge. An Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them. When each had fully stated his case the Ape announced this sentence: “I do not think you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim; and I do believe you, Fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly deny.”
The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.
원 세상에나 늑대가 “내 걸 도둑질 했어요”라며 여우를 고소했지 뭐에요.
물론 여우는 완전히 부정하고 나섰죠.
이 사건이 옳고 그름은 온전히 원숭이 판사에게 맡겨졌답니다.
각자의 얘기를 충분히 들은 원숭이 판사는 다음과 같은 결론을 내렸어요.
“도저히 늑대가 무슨 물건을 잃었을 거로 생각되지 않소. 또한 여우가 무슨 물건을 도둑질하지 않았으리라고도 생각되지 않소.”
정직하게 행동해야해요. 안 그럼 결정적인 순간에 아무도 내 말을 믿어주지 않거든요.

A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the Draught-Mule said, “How slow you are! Why do you not go faster? See if I do not prick your neck with my sting.” The Draught-Mule replied, “I do not heed your threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my pace with his whip, or holds me back with the reins. Away, therefore, with your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go slow.”
파리가 짐마차의 굴대(=막대기. 마차 바퀴 한 가운데에 뚫린 구멍에 끼우는 막대기) 위에 앉으며 ‘짐 끄는 노새’에게 말했어요.
“느려 터져 가지곤! 좀 더 빨리 갈 순 없어? 아님 내가 침으로 네 놈 목을 찔러줘야 더 빨리 가겠니.”
‘짐 끄는 노새’가 대꾸했어요.
“너부터 걱정해. 난 너 위에 앉아 있는 주인만 신경 쓰고 있으니까. 내 속도는 그의 채찍과 고삐를 당기는 것에 맞춰져 있단다. 그러니 꺼지고 네 볼 일이나 봐. 난 언제 빨리 가야하고 언제 느리게 가야할 때는 아는 놈이니까.”

219. 어부들 (이솝 우화)
​

SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them to be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken a large catch. When they had dragged the nets to the shore they found but few fish: the nets were full of sand and stones, and the men were beyond measure cast down so much at the disappointment which had befallen them, but because they had formed such very different expectations. One of their company, an old man, said, “Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for, as it seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was only to be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced, should next have something to make us sad.”
몇몇 어부들이 그물을 끌어당기고 있었어요.
그런데 그물이 꽤나 묵직한 거 있죠, 그래서 어부들은 덩실덩실 춤을 추었답니다.
“분명 큰 물고기가 잡힌 게야.”
그들이 그물을 해안가로 다 끌어당겼을 때 보니 그건 그저 그런 물고기 몇 마리가 잡힌 거일 뿐이었어요. 그물엔 돌들과 모래로 가득했죠.
자신들에게 닫친 불운에 실망한 어부들이 그걸 집어던지며 화풀이를 했어요. 실망감이 컸던 거죠.
그들 중 나이 지극한 어부가 말했어요.
“여보게들, 한탄 그만들 하세나, 내가 보기엔 슬픔과 기쁨은 항시 쌍둥이 자매 같았지. 그러니 방금 전 슬픈 일이 지나갔으니 이제 기쁜 일이 두 배로 올 걸세.”

THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to attack them while they kept together. Having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked them without fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own leisure.
Union is strength.

A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky. While thus looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just before his feet. The Viper, turning about, stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, “Woe is me! that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death.”
어느 새잡이가 끈끈이(끈끈한 물질)와 나뭇가지를 챙겨 새를 잡으러 나갔어요.

A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. “Hardly,” said the Horse, “can I resist kicking you with my heels.” The Ass held his peace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods. Not long afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his owner to the farm. The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him: “Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?’

227. 의사가 된 구두 수선공


227. The Cobbler Turned Doctor
227. 의사가 된 구두 수선공 (이솝 우화)
​

A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known. He sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and advertisements. When the Cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness, the Governor of the town determined to test his skill.
도저히 자신의 직업으로 생계를 유지해나갈 수가 없던 구두 수선공이 자신을 전혀 모르는 도시로 가더니 유명한 의사 행세를 하기 시작했어요.
그는 모든 독을 치유하는 약이 있다며 팔기 시작하더니 곧 어마어마한 명성과 돈을 거머쥐게 되었답니다. 원체 뻥이 심한 친구였는데 그게 돌팔이 의사 행세와 통한 거지요.
그러다 그가 덜컥 중병에 걸려 눕게 되는 사태가 벌어지자, 도시의 시장이 그(돌팔이 의사)의 솜씨를 시험해보기로 마음먹었어요.
​

For this purpose he called for a cup, and while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison with the Cobbler’s antidote, commanding him to drink it on the promise of a reward. The Cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd. The Governor then called a public assembly and addressed the citizens: “Of what folly have you been guilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man, whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their feet.”
이를 위해 시장은 컵을 하나 가져오게 해 물을 부었어요. 그리곤 마치 독과 구두 수선공이 파는 약을 혼합하는 척 연기하곤, 구두 수선공보고 “당신 병이 나을 테니 드시구려.”라고 말했어요.
겁을 집어먹은 구두 수선공은 어쩔 수 없이 “저는 의술을 전혀 모릅니다. 그동안 어리석은 말들로 사람들을 속여 유명해진 거였습니다.”라며 자백을 하기에 이르렀지요.
시장이 즉시 사람들을 모이게 하더니 다음과 같이 발표하였지요.
“얼마나 어리석소? 그래 신발도 제대로 만들지 못하는 자에게 목숨을 맡기려들 들었단 말이오.”

228. 늑대와 말


228. The Wolf and the Horse
228. 늑대와 말 (이솝 우화)
​

A WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus addressed him: “I would advise you to go into that field. It is full of fine oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you are a friend whom I would love to hear enjoying good eating.” The Horse replied, “If oats had been the food of wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly.”
Men of evil reputation, when they perform a good deed, fail to get credit for it.
늑대가 귀리 밭에서 막 나오다 말과 마주쳤는데 이렇게 말하는 거예요.
“때마침 잘 만났네, 이 밭으로 오라고, 여긴 맛난 귀리가 가득해, 난 입도 대지 않았다고, 난 그저 네가 귀리를 맛나게 씹는 소리만 들어도 배가 부르거든.”
말이 기가 찬다는 듯 말했어요.
“늑대가 귀리를 먹을 수 있었으면 절대 그런 소리가 안 나올까, 아마 귀고 뭐고 배를 채우느라 바빴겠지.”
나쁜 사람이 선한 척 할 때엔 뭔가 꿍꿍이 속이 있는 거에요.

229. 오빠와 여동생


229. The Brother and the Sister
229. 오빠와 여동생 (이솝 우화)
​

A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. While they were playing one day as children, they happened by chance to look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother’s chair. The boy congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl grew angry, and could not bear the self-praises of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and how could she do otherwise?) into reflection on herself.
아빠에게 아들 하나와 딸 하나가 있었어요.
그런데 오빠는 엄청 잘 생긴데 반해 딸애는 엄청 못생겼지요.
어릴 때 함께 놀던 아이들이 엄마 의자에 놓인 거울을 들여다볼 기회를 얻었지요.
소년은 잘생긴 자신의 얼굴을 보고 좋아했지만, 소녀는 발끈했어요. 오빠만 잘생긴 걸 도무지 참을 수가 없었죠. 그리고 오빠 말을 다 나쁘게 받아들였어요. 혼자 끙끙 앓은 거죠.
​
​
She ran off to her father. to be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls. The father embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection impartially on each, said, “I wish you both would look into the mirror every day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for your lack of beauty by your virtues.”
그녀는 아빠에게 달려가 오빠를 헐뜯었어요.
“아빠, 오빠가 장난 쳐, 여자애처럼 행동해.”
그럴 때면 아빠는 그들 둘을 포근히 앉아주곤 아이들의 볼에 한명씩 다정하게 키스를 해주었답니다.
아빠가 말했어요.
“아빤 너희들이 매일 거울을 들여다봤음 한단다. 그럼 오빠인 너는 거울을 보며 나쁜 행동이 네 아름다움을 망치는 걸 막을 수 있을 거고, 그리고 너 내 딸은 미덕으로 약간 부족한 아름다움을 채워나갈 수 있을 거잖니.”

230. 말벌들과 메추라기들과 농부


230. The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer
230. 말벌들과 메추라기들과 농부 (이솝 우화)
​

THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a Farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink. They promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked. The Partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make them produce finer grapes. The Wasps said that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their stings. But the Farmer interrupted them, saying: “I have already two oxen, who, without making any promises, do all these things. It is surely better for me to give the water to them than to you.”
말벌들과 메추라기들이 간신히 목마름을 참고 있는데, 때마침 농부가 다가오기에, 말벌들과 메추라기들이 “제발 저희들에게 물 좀 주세요.”라고 간청했어요.
그렇게만 해주면 그들은 은혜를 꼭 갚겠다 말했지요.
먼저, 메추라기들이 말했어요.
“이제부터라도 저희들이 당신의 포도나무들 주변 땅을 파헤쳐놓아 포도나무들이 더 많은 포도를 열게 만들어드릴게요.”
말벌들도 지지 않고 말했어요.
“저희들도 이제부터 당신의 포도나무들을 지키며 포도를 훔쳐가려는 도둑이 나타나면 따끔하게 벌침을 놓아드릴게요.”
농부가 그들을 제지하며 말했어요.
“나에겐 이미 그런 일들을 도맡아 해주는 황소가 두 마리씩이나 있단다. 그러니 이 물은 너희들에게보다 그 황소들에게 주는 게 더 낫겠구나.”

231. 까마귀와 헤르메스


231. The Crow and Mercury
231. 까마귀와 헤르메스 (이솝 우화)
​

A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when rescued from his danger, he forgot his promise. Shortly afterwards, again caught in a snare, he passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon appeared and said to him, “O thou most base fellow? how can I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?’
덫에 걸린 까마귀가 아폴로 신에게 기도했어요.
“저 좀 풀어주세요, 그럼 제가 유향(고급 향료)을 바칠게요.”
하지만 위험에서 풀려나자 까마귀는 자신이 한 약속을 쫄딱 잊고 말았죠.
곧 그는 다시 덫에 걸리고 말았어요.
그는 이번엔 아폴로 대신 헤르메스 신(도둑과 목동과 상업의 신. 신들의 심부름꾼 신)에게 “유향을 바칠게요.”라고 약속을 드렸어요. 똑같은 약속을 한 거죠.
금방 헤르메스 신이 나타나더니 까마귀에게 대뜸 이렇게 말했어요.
“멍청한 놈 같으니라고? 내가 너를 어찌 믿고, 네 전(이전) 수호신처럼 배신당하라고 널 구해주란 말이냐?”

232. 북풍과 해님


232. The North Wind and the Sun
232. 북풍과 해님 (이솝 우화)
​

THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North Wind first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the Traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called upon the Sun to see what he could do. The Sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path.
Persuasion is better than Force.
북풍과 해님이 누가 더 힘이 센가를 두고 논쟁을 벌였어요. 그러다 때마침 지나가는 여행자가 보이기에 이 사람의 옷을 먼저 벗기는 쪽이 이기는 걸로 정했지요.
먼저 북풍이 자신의 힘센 바람을 그 여행자를 향해 후 불었어요. 북풍이 매서운 강풍을 불면 불수록 여행자는 자신의 외투로 온 몸을 꽁꽁 싸맸어요.
마침내 나아질 기미가 보이지 않자 북풍은 차례를 해님에게 넘겨주며 어찌 되나 보았죠.
해님은 순간 여행자 위로 햇살을 내비쳤어요.
온화한 빛줄기가 여행자에게 가 닿자마자 그는 차례차례 옷을 하나씩 벗기 시작하더니 마침내는 더운 열기에 굴복해 옷을 모두 벗어버리곤 길가 옆 개울에 뛰어들어 몸을 적셨답니다.
설득이 강요보다 나을 때가 많죠.

233. 서로 적이 된 두 남자


233. The Two Men Who Were Enemies
233. 서로 적이 된 두 남자 (이솝 우화)
​

TWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated himself in the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship. A violent storm arose, and with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the one in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down first. On his replying that he supposed it would be the prow, the Man said, “Death would not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy die before me.”
서로 끔찍하게도 싫은 적이 된 두 사람이 우연히 같은 배를 타게 되었어요.
서로 가능한 한 멀찍이 있기 위해 한 사람은 배 끝에 앉았고, 또 한 사람은 배 앞에 앉았지요.
강렬한 폭풍이 몰아치더니 배가 가라앉기 일보 직전이 되자 배 끝에 앉아 있던 사람이 선장에게 “배 앞과 배 뒤 중 어느 쪽이 먼저 가라앉을 거 같소?”라고 물었어요.
“배 앞이 먼저 가라앉을 거 같습니다.”라는 선장의 대답이 돌아오자 그 사람이 말했어요.
“저 놈이 먼저 죽는 꼴만 볼 수 있다면야, 죽는 거쯤이야 무섭지 않다.”

234. 싸움닭들과 자고새


234. The Gamecocks and the Partridge
234. 싸움닭들과 자고새 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard. One day by chance he found a tame Partridge for sale. He purchased it and brought it home to be reared with his Gamecocks. When the Partridge was put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a stranger. Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together and not separating before one had well beaten the other. He then said to himself, “I shall no longer distress myself at being struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even refrain from quarreling with each other.”
닭장에 싸움닭 두 마리를 키우고 있던 사람이 우연히도 시장에 들렀다 판매용으로 나온 귀여운 자고새 한 마리를 보았어요.
그는 그 자고새를 자신의 싸움닭들과 함께 키울 생각으로 사서 집으로 가지고 돌아왔어요.
닭장에 들어간 자고새는 그때부터 곤욕을 치렀답니다. 싸움닭들이 한시도 그를 가만두지 않고 뒤 쫓아와 쪼아댔기 때문이지요.
이에 자고새가 크게 슬퍼하며 이는 다 자신이 낯선 손님이라 그러려니 이해했어요.
머지않아 자고새는 수탉들이 저희들끼리 싸우는 것을 보았어요. 하나가 상대방을 때려눕힐 때까지 싸우는 모습을 말이죠.
그제야 상황을 이해하게 된 자고새가 혼잣말로 말했어요.
“더는 저 싸움닭들 때문에 내가 상심할 필요가 없겠어, 이제 보니 저들은 한시도 다두지 않곤 못 사는 족속들이었잖아.”

236. 사자와 늑대와 여우


236. The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox
236. 사자와 늑대와 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came to visit their king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking that he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit him. At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last words of the Wolf.
나이 든 사자가 자기 굴에 아파 누워 있었답니다.
그러자 모든 동물들이 병문안을 왔어요, 여우만 제외하고 말이죠.
이걸 복수할 절호의 기회라 여긴 늑대가 사자에게 모든 동물들이 다녀갔는데 오직 여우만 왕을 찾아오지 않았다며 주의를 환기시켰어요.
때마침 여우가 들어오다 늑대가 한 마지막 몇 마디만 알아들었죠.
​

The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and said, “And who of all those who have come to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from the physicians the means of healing you?’ The Lion commanded him immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, “You must flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you.” The Wolf was at once taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, “You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, will.”
사자가 여우에게 호통을 치며 화를 냈어요.
빠져나갈 방법을 찾던 여우가 말했어요.
“저만큼 사자님을 걱정하며 돌아다닌 자도 없습니다요, 저는 지금껏 방방곳곳을 돌아다니며 용하다는 의사들을 죄다 만나 사자님을 치유할 방법을 물었어요?”
귀가 솔깃해진 사자가 즉시 그 치유책이 뭔지 물었어요.
여우가 대답했지요.
“산 늑대를 잡아다 가죽을 벗기고, 채 식지 않은 그 가죽으로 몸을 감싸 열기를 느끼는 것입니다요.”
사자는 그 즉시 늑대를 잡아다 가죽을 벗겨버렸지요.
그제야 여우가 늑대 쪽으로 고개를 돌리며 엿은 미소를 지어보이며 말했어요.
“그러니 애당초 모략을 꾸미지 말았어야지.”

IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a house. However when the summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a great size. Now he considered that it would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would accommodate him.
겨울에, 개가 추위를 이기려고 좁은 공간에서 오그리고 자고 있었어요. 그러다 집을 한 채 짓기로 결심했지요.
하지만 다시 여름이 돌아와, 대(大)자로 누워 잘 수 있게 되자, 마음이 넉넉해지며 굳이 잠잘 집을 만들 필요성도 느끼지 못했답니다.

ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, “Why should I, being of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?’ While he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and killed him. He exclaimed with a too late repentance, “Wretched me! this overestimation of myself is the cause of my destruction.”
해질 무렵 산허리에서 어슬렁거리던 늑대는 자신의 그림자가 엄청 크게 확대되는 것을 보곤 혼자 말했어요.
“얼씨구, 4제곱미터(2미터x2미터)까지도 더 커지겠는 걸, 이런 내가 왜 사자를 두려워해? 동물들을 모아놓고 내가 왕이라 선포하지 못할 이유가 없잖아?”
늑대가 이렇게 한껏 고양된 채 걸어 다니다, 느닷없이 만난 사자가 그를 죽어버렸어요.
후회해도 너무 늦었다는 걸 알고 늑대가 말했어요.
“이래도 싸지! 과신(스스로를 크게 믿음)이 나를 망친 거야.”

THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns the conquerors. A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight, always fought on the side which he felt was the strongest. When peace was proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both combatants. Therefore being condemned by each for his treachery, he was driven forth from the light of day, and henceforth concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone and at night.
새들이 짐승들과 전쟁을 벌였어요.
서로 한 번씩 전세가 역전되길 반복했지요.

그러자 양쪽 편에 붙었던 박쥐의 사기 행각이 단번에 드러나고 말았죠.
이로 말미암아 박쥐는 양쪽 편에서 배반자란 칭호를 얻게 되어 낮에 내쫓기고 말았답니다.
이후 박쥐는 낮엔 꽁꽁 숨어 지내다 밤에만 날아다니게 되었답니다.

240. 방탕아(낭비자)와 제비 (이솝 우화)
​

A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his patrimony and had but one good cloak left. One day he happened to see a Swallow, which had appeared before its season, skimming along a pool and twittering gaily. He supposed that summer had come, and went and sold his cloak. Not many days later, winter set in again with renewed frost and cold. When he found the unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he said, “Unhappy bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the springtime you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my destruction also.”
어머나, 젊은 사람이 어찌나 낭비벽이 심한지 재산을 몽땅 탕진하고 딸랑 명품 외투 하나만 남았지 뭐예요.
그러던 어느 날 때 이르게 찾아온 제비 한 마리가 물가를 따라 날며 명랑하게 재잘거리 걸 보고 말았죠.
이에 청년은 벌써 여름이 왔다 생각하고선 자신의 외투마저 팔아버렸어요.
며칠 못가 겨울철 서리와 추위가 되살아났고, 그는 땅바닥에 죽어 있는 그 불행한 제비를 발견하곤 이렇게 말했지요.
“불행한 새야! 어찌된 거니? 네가 때 이르게 찾아온 죄로 너만 죽게 된 것이 아니라 이제 나도 골로 가게 생겼잖니.”

242. 부엉이와 새들 (이솝 우화)
​

AN OWL, in her wisdom, counseled the Birds that when the acorn first began to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it to grow. She said acorns would produce mistletoe, from which an irremediable poison, the bird — lime, would be extracted and by which they would be captured. The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax, which men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them.
끈끈이나무(감탕나무)가 처음 땅에 쏟아나 새싹을 피웠을 때 지혜로운 부엉이는 새들에게 “새싹을 모두 쪼아 먹어 더는 자라지 못하게 해야 해요.”라고 조언했어요.
부엉이는 말했죠.
“끈끈이나무의 껍질로 새들에게 치명적인 끈끈이를 만들어낼 수 있는데, 이 끈끈이가 여러분들을 잡히게 할 거예요.”
아마(아마 껍질의 섬유로 피륙을 짬) 씨앗이 돋아났을 때에도 부엉이의 조언은 이어졌지요.
“사람들이 뿌린 이 씨앗에서 자나나는 식물은 새들에겐 불행의 징조랍니다.”
​​
​
And, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted that this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. The Birds gave no credence to these warning words, but considered the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds. Hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things, while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments their past folly.
결국 부엉이는, 활을 쏘는 사람이 다가오는 걸 보았는데 역시나 부엉이의 예언대로 그는 깃털을 단 화살을 고안해 내더니 제일 빠른 새들보다도 더 빨리 화살을 날려 보낼 수 있게 되었어요.
사실 새들은 부엉이의 이러한 경고들을 신뢰하지 않고 제정신이 아닌 걸로 여기고선 제꺼 놓았지만, 이렇게 계속해서 그의 말이 적중하자, 새들도 부엉이의 지혜에 경이를 표하게 되었고 새들 중에 가장 현명한 새로 인증하게 되었지요.
이제는 부엉이가 나타나면 새들은 배울 게 없는지 알아보려 다가왔어요.
하지만 부엉이는 더는 그들에게 조언을 해주지 않고 그냥 대중의 지난 어리석음을 애석해하며 고독한 한숨만 내쉬곤했다네요.

243. 포로로 잡힌 나팔수


243. The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner
243. 포로로 잡힌 나팔수 (이솝 우화)
​

A TRUMPETER, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by the enemy. He cried out to his captors, “Pray spare me, and do not take my life without cause or without inquiry. I have not slain a single man of your troop. I have no arms, and carry nothing but this one brass trumpet.” “That is the very reason for which you should be put to death,” they said; “for, while you do not fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others to battle.”
전쟁에서 용맹하게 앞장서며 나팔소리로 병사들을 이끌던 나팔수가 적에게 붙잡히고 말았어요.
그는 적들보고 자신을 살려달라 애걸했어요.
“살려주십시오, 저는 당신들에게 직접적인 피해와 상처를 입힌 적이 없습니다. 저는 누구도 죽인 적도 없습니다. 전 무장도 하지 않았고, 단지 황동 나팔 하나만 들고 다녔을 뿐입니다.”
“그러니 널 죽이겠다는 거다,”라며 적들이 말했어요. “왜냐면 넌 싸우지도 않으면서 나팔소리로 다른 사람들이 싸우게 선동했기 때문이지.”

​

AN ASS, having put on the Lion’s skin, roamed about in the forest and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his wanderings. At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to frighten him also, but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed, “I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your bray.”
사자 가죽을 뒤집어쓴 당나귀가 숲 여기저기를 어슬렁거렸어요.
그와 마주치는 어리석은 동물들을 죄다 당나귀의 이 기괴한 모습에 기겁을 하며 놀라고 말았죠.
당나귀는 재밌어서 죽을 맛이었고요.
저기 여우가 오고 있네요. 당나귀가 이번에도 놀래키려고 하는데, 당나귀의 목소리를 듣자마자 여우가 낌새를 채곤 말했어요.
“네 당나귀 울음소리만 아니었어도 나도 화들짝 놀랐을 거야.”

​

A HARE pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries like a child. A Sparrow upbraided her and said, “Where now is thy remarkable swiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?” While the Sparrow was thus speaking, a hawk suddenly seized him and killed him. The Hare was comforted in her death, and expiring said, “Ah! you who so lately, when you supposed yourself safe, exulted over my calamity, have now reason to deplore a similar misfortune.”
세상에, 독수리가 산토끼에게 달려들더니 발톱으로 꽉 물고 늘어졌어요.
즉각 산토끼가 아기처럼 울고 불며 재발 놓아 달라 사정 사정을 했어요.
보다 못한 참새 한 마리가 산토끼보고 말했어요.
“그 재빠른 네 발은 두었다 뭐하니? 잽싸게 도망치면 되잖니?”
참새가 그 말을 하고 있던 사이, 매가 느닷없이 참새를 낚아채더니 죽여 버렸어요.
참새의 죽음에 그나마 위안을 받으며 산토끼가 마지막 숨을 몰아쉬며 말했지요.
“참내! 방금 지는 안전하다 여기고선 내 불행에 기뻐하더니, 어때 이제 같은 처지에 놓이니 뭐가 좀 보이니.”

246. 벼룩과 황소 (이솝 우화)
​

A FLEA thus questioned an Ox: “What ails you, that being so huge and strong, you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and slave for them day by day, while I, being so small a creature, mercilessly feed on their flesh and drink their blood without stint?’ The Ox replied: “I do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am loved and well cared for by men, and they often pat my head and shoulders.” “Woe’s me!” said the flea; “this very patting which you like, whenever it happens to me, brings with it my inevitable destruction.”
벼룩이 황소에게 물었어요.
“어찌된 거니, 넌 엄청 커고 힘도 센데, 왜 인간들한테 구속돼 매일을 노예처럼 일을 하지, 날 보라고, 난 작은 생물이지만 인간의 살점에 붙어 피를 마음껏 들이키잖니?”
황소가 대답했어요.
“그렇다고 배은망덕할 순 없잖니, 난 사람들에게서 사랑을 받고 있고 보살핌도 잘 받고 있는데, 그들은 종종 내 머리와 어깨를 토닥이며 애정을 표현해주기까지 한다고.”
“아 골 때리네!”라며 벼룩이 말했어요. “누가 내게 그런 토닥임을 주었다간 난 흔적도 없이 뭉개지고 말거거든.”

247. 선과 악


247. The Goods and the Ills
247. 선과 악 (이솝 우화)
​

ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills, as they had nothing in common and could not live together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection.
인간사에 반반씩 같이 관여하고 잇던 선이 악에 의해 완전히 내쫓기고 말았어요.
악이 이 땅에서 너무도 범람했기 때문이죠.
선은 하늘로 올라가 자신들을 박해한 악에게 응당한 처벌을 내려달라 요구했어요.
선은 제우스에게 다음과 같이 탄원했어요.
“저희들은 악들과는 하나도 닮지 않아 더는 같이 지낼 수 없거니와 끊임없이 다툼을 벌이니, 변치 않는 법칙을 정해주셔서 선인 저희의 안전을 보장해주십시오.”
​

Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men. Hence it arises that Ills abound, for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no means singly: while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those who are able to discern them.
제우스가 그들의 요청을 받아들였고, 향후엔 악이 지상을 방문할 때엔 떼거리로 몰려가야만 하고, 선이 인간의 집에 들어갈 때엔 선 한명씩만 가야한다고 말했어요.
그리되니 이제는 정말 온 사방에 악이 넘쳐나게 되었지요, 왜냐면 악이 인간을 찾아올 때엔 한명씩이 아니라 무더기로 찾아오게 되었으니까요.
반면 선은 제우스에게서 출발해 한명씩만 따로따로 그리고 드문드문 와야 했기에, 사람의 눈에도 하나씩만 간신히 눈에 띄게 된 거랍니다.

249. 헤르메스와 나무꾼


249. Mercury and the Workmen
249. 헤르메스와 나무꾼 (이솝 우화)
​

A WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe drop — by accident into a deep pool. Being thus deprived of the means of his livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate. Mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. After he told him his misfortune, Mercury plunged into the stream, and, bringing up a golden axe, inquired if that were the one he had lost. On his saying that it was not his, Mercury disappeared beneath the water a second time, returned with a silver axe in his hand, and again asked the Workman if it were his.
나무꾼이 강 옆에서 나무를 베다 도끼를 떨어뜨리는 바람에 풍덩하고 도끼가 깊은 못 속에 빠지고 말았어요.
생계 수간을 잃은 그가 강둑에 주저앉아 펑펑 울기 시작했어요.
헤르메스 신이 나타나더니 “왜 우는지?”를 물었어요.
그가 자신의 불운을 말씀드리자, 헤르메스가 물속에 들어가시더니 이내 황금 도끼를 꺼내 “이게 자네가 잃어버렸다는 그 도끼인가?”를 물었어요.
“그건 제게 아니옵니다.”라고 그가 말하자, 헤르메스가 다시 물 아래로 모습을 감추더니 이내 곧 은도끼를 손에 쥐고 나타나 “그럼 이 도끼가 네 도끼냐?”라고 물었어요.
​
​
When the Workman said it was not, he dived into the pool for the third time and brought up the axe that had been lost. The Workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery. Mercury, pleased with his honesty, gave him the golden and silver axes in addition to his own. The Workman, on his return to his house, related to his companions all that had happened. One of them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for himself. He ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the same place, and sat down on the bank to weep.
“아니옵니다, 그것도 제 도끼가 아니옵니다.”라고 나무꾼이 말하자, 헤르메스가 세 번째로 물속으로 다이빙을 해 이번에 그가 잃어버린 그 도끼를 가지고 돌아왔어요.
“맞습니다, 그게 제 도끼입니다.”라며 나무꾼은 자신의 도끼를 되찾은 것에 크게 만족했어요.
이 정직한 마음씨가 마음에 든 헤르메스가 황금도끼와 은도끼 또한 그에게 선물로 주었어요.
숙소로 돌아온 나무꾼은 동료들에게 오늘 있었던 일들을 말해주었어요.
동료들 중 한 명이 자신도 따라해 보고 동일한 행운을 얻기로 결심했어요.
그는 강으로 가 동일한 장소의 물속으로 도끼를 냅다 내던지곤 강둑에 주저앉아 펑펑 울기 시작했어요.
​
​
Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would; and having learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the stream and brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. The Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the very same axe that he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his knavery, not only took away the golden axe, but refused to recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool.
그가 바란 대로 곧 헤르메스 신이 나타나더니 자초지종을 듣곤 물로 뛰어들더니 이내 황금도끼를 꺼내며 “이게 네가 잃었다는 그 도끼냐?”라고 물어왔어요.
탐욕에 눈이 먼 그가 단번에 “맞습니다, 그게 바로 제가 잃어버린 그 도끼입니다요.”라고 말했어요.
이 속임수에 발끈한 헤르메스 신은 그 황금도끼를 내주지 않았을 뿐만 아니라 나무꾼이 우물에 내던지 원래 도끼까지도 되찾아주기를 거절했답니다.

250. 독수리와 갈까마귀


250. The Eagle and the Jackdaw
250. 독수리와 갈까마귀 (이솝 우화)
​

AN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized upon a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons. A Jackdaw, who witnessed the capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle. He flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a large ram, with the intention of carrying him off, but his claws became entangled in the ram’s fleece and he was not able to release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as much as he could.
독수리 한 마리가 높은 바위 꼭대기에서 손살 같이 내려오더니 발톱으로 어린 양을 움켜쥐곤 그대로 날아가 버렸어요.
어린 양이 붙들려가는 걸 목격한 갈까마귀(까마귀보다 몸집이 작고 사납게 우는 까마귀)가 질투심이 샘솟아 자신도 한 번 그리해보고 싶었어요. 독수리의 힘과 비행능력과 자신을 비교해보고 싶었거든요.
갈까마귀는 날개를 크게 휘저으며 빙빙 돌더니 큰 숫양에게 내려앉아 거뜬히 들고 날아가 버릴 생각으로 훅하고 드는데 아니 이게 웬일인가요, 발톱들이 숫양의 털에 뒤엉키는 바람에 놓지도 못하고 속절없는 날갯짓만 무진장 해대는 꼴이 되고 말았어요.
​

The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and caught him. He at once clipped the Jackdaw’s wings, and taking him home at night, gave him to his children. On their saying, “Father, what kind of bird is it?’ he replied, “To my certain knowledge he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle.”
뭔 일이 일어났나 보던 양치기가 급히 달려와 갈까마귀를 사로잡았죠.
그는 갈까마귀의 날개를 묶어 밤에 집으로 돌아가 자신의 아이들에게 선물로 주었답니다.
아이들이 “아빠, 이 새는 뭐야?”라고 묻자, 양치기는 이렇게 대답했지요. “확실히 내가 보기엔 바보 까마귀 같은데, 글쎄 자신이 독수리인줄 알지 뭐니.”

251. 여우와 학 (이솝 우화)
​

A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded the Fox much amusement. The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure. The Fox, unable even to taste it, met with a fitting requital, after the fashion of her own hospitality.
여우가 학을 저녁식사에 초대했는데, 오락은 하나도 없고 콩으로 만든 수프만 그것도 넓고 펑퍼짐한 돌 접시에 담아 내놓지 않았겠어요.
학의 긴 부리(입)로는 그 수프를 먹을 수가 없었어요. 학이 그렇게 배를 쫄쫄 굶고 있는데 여우는 자기 배를 채우느라 바빴죠.
이번에는 학이 여우를 저녁식사에 초대했는데, 주둥이 부분이 길고 좁은 포도주 병에 음식을 내왔지 뭐예요.
학은 자유롭게 목을 병에 넣고 음식물을 쉽게 먹을 수 있었지만, 반면 여우는 입도 대지 못했죠.
아셨죠, 이건 학의 복수였어요. 남을 푸대접하면 그리되는 거랍니다.

252. 제우스, 포세이돈, 아테네, 모모스(불평과 비난의 신)


252. Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus
252. 제우스, 포세이돈, 아테네, 모모스(불평과 비난의 신) (이솝 우화)
​

ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by Jupiter, the first bull by Neptune, and the first house by Minerva. On the completion of their labors, a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect work. They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision. Momus, however, being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with all. He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see where to strike.
고대 전설에 따르면, 첫 인간은 제우스가 만들었고, 첫 황소는 포세이돈(바다의 신)이 만들었고, 첫 집은 아테네 여신이 만들었데요.
각자 일을 마무리 짓자 곧 그들 사이에 누구의 작품이 더 완벽한지를 놓고 논쟁이 벌어졌어요.
그들은 모모스(그리스 신화. 불평과 비난의 신 이름)에게 판정을 맡기고 그의 의견에 따르기로 했지요.
하지만 모모스는 판정은커녕 가만 보니 신들의 완벽한 솜씨에 그만 시기심이 일어 하나하나 다 꼬치꼬치 물고 늘어졌지요.
포세이돈의 작품을 보곤,
“왜 황소의 뿔을 눈 바로 밑에 만들지 않은 거죠, 그랬다면 적을 더 잘 찔렀을 거 아녜요?”
라고 잔소리를 했지요.
​
​
He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the intended mischief. And, lastly, he inveighed against Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant. Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from the mansions of Olympus.
그런 다음 모모스는 제우스의 작품도 혹평하고 나섰어요.
“왜 인간의 심장을 밖으로 내놓지 않았죠, 그랬다면 모든 이들이 서로 상대방의 적의를 더 잘 읽을 수 있었을 것이고 그럼 해악을 미연에 막아낼 수 있었을 거잖아요.”
마지막으로 모모스는 아테네 여신에게도 테클을 걸고 넘어졌어요.
“왜 집의 기초(바닥)를 철제 바퀴식으로 만들지 않은 거지요, 그럼 집주인이 이웃과 분쟁이 생겼을 때 더 쉽게 이사를 할 수 있었을 거잖아요.”
이런 꼬투리를 잡기 위한 꼬투리에 발끈한 제우스는 모모스를 당장에 재판장 지위에서 쫓아버리곤 덩달아 올림푸스 신전(신들의 궁전)에서도 추방해버렸답니다.

253. 독수리와 여우


253. The Eagle and the Fox
253. 독수리와 여우 (이솝 우화)
​

AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live near each other. The Eagle built her nest in the branches of a tall tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her young. Not long after they had agreed upon this plan, the Eagle, being in want of provision for her young ones, swooped down while the Fox was out, seized upon one of the little cubs, and feasted herself and her brood. The Fox on her return, discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to avenge them.
독수리와 여우가 우정을 맺고 가까이에서 살기로 결심했어요.
독수리는 높은 나무의 가지에 둥지를 만들었어요, 한편 여우도 그 나무 밑에 굴을 파서 집을 만들곤 새끼들을 낳았지요.
그들의 집이 완성되고 머지않아 독수리가 자기 새끼들에게 줄 식량이 부족해졌어요.
그러자 여우가 집을 비운 사이, 독수리가 와락 내려오더니 어린 여우의 새끼들 중 한 명을 움켜쥐곤 올라가 자신과 아이들의 먹이로 먹어버렸어요.
집에 돌아온 여우는 무슨 일이 일어났는지를 알았고, 어린 새끼를 잃은 것보다 높은 나무 위에 있는 독수리에게 복수할 방법이 없는 걸 더 원통해했어요.
​
​
A just retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle. While hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along with a burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree. There, in the sight of the Eagle, the Fox gobbled them up.
하지만 복수의 기회는 금방 찾아왔어요.
제단(탁자) 가까이에서 빙빙 돌던 독수리가 시골 사람들이 제단에 바친 염소에 눈독을 들이곤 손살 같이 내려와 살점 하나를 움켜쥐고 자기 둥지로 날아갔는데, 그만 살점과 함께 타다 남은 불씨까지 같이 둥지로 딸려오고 말았답니다.
곧 강풍이 불어와 작은 불씨가 큰 화염이 되어 새끼 독수리들이 속절없이 둥지에서 타죽다 나무 아래로 떨어지고 말았어요.
이때 독수리가 빤히 쳐다보고 있는 와중에 여우가 와락 새끼 독수리의 시신들을 꿀꺽꿀꺽 삼켜버렸답니다.

254. The Man and the Satyr
254. 사람과 ‘사티로스’(상반신은 사람, 하반신은 염소) (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold. Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite scalding. The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot. “I can no longer consider you as a friend,” said the Satyr, “a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.”
사람과 ‘사티로스’(그리스신화 속 괴물. 상반신은 사람, 하반신은 염소)가 친구관계를 맺은 걸 기념해 함께 술을 마셨어요.
때마침 추운 겨울이었던지라 그들이 대화를 나누는 종종 사람은 자신의 손가락을 입에 대고 호호 불곤 했어요.
사티로스가 그 이유를 물었더니, 사람은 “날이 추워 손을 데우려고 그래”라고 말했어요.
며칠 후 그들이 함께 자리에 앉아 식사를 하게 되었어요.
그런데 내온 음식이 너무 뜨거웠답니다.
그러자 사람이 접시들 중 하나를 살짝 입가에 대더니 후후 불었어요.
사티로스가 한 번 더 그 이유를 물었더니, 사람은 “고기가 너무 뜨거워 식히려고 그래”라고 말했어요.
“도저히 사람 너희들과는 친구가 될 수 없겠다,”라며 사티로스가 말했어요. “한 입으로 더운 기운 차가운 기운을 부는 자를 어찌 친구로 삼는단 말이냐.”

255. 당나귀와 구매자


255. The Ass and His Purchaser
255. 당나귀와 구매자 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that he should try out the animal before he bought him. He took the Ass home and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all. Seeing this, the man put a halter on him and led him back to his owner. On being asked how, in so short a time, he could have made a trial of him, he answered, “I do not need a trial; I know that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his companion.”
A man is known by the company he keeps.
당나귀를 사고 싶었던 사람이 있었어요. 그래서 돈을 주기 전에 동물을 집으로 데려가 일을 부려본 다음 사기로 했지요.
그는 그 당나귀를 집으로 데려와 가축우리에 있는 다른 당나귀들 사이에 넣었어요.
그러자 새 동물이 다른 당나귀는 제쳐두고 이 집에서 가장 게으르고 가장 밥만 축내는 당나귀 옆에 가 서는 거예요.
이를 본 사람이 단번에 그 당나귀에게 고삐를 매곤 도로 원래 주인에게로 데리고 갔어요.
원래 주인이 테스트가 왜 이리 금방 끝났는지 이유를 묻자, 그(당나귀를 사려던 사람)가 대답했어요.
“보나 마나에요. 친구를 보면 그 사람을 알 수 있어서요.”
농담이 아니랍니다, 그 사람을 알려면 그가 사귀는 친구를 보면 되요.

256. 두 개의 주머니


256. The Two Bags
256. 두 개의 주머니 (이솝 우화)
​

EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world with two bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full of his neighbors’ faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own faults. Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of others, and yet are often blind to their own failings.
고대의 전설에 따르면, 모든 사람들은 태어나면서부터 목에 두 개의 주머니를 앞뒤로 차고 나온다고 합니다.
앞에 있는 주머니엔 이웃의 잘못이 가득 차있고, 뒤에 있는 주머니엔 자기 자신의 결점들이 가득 차있다고 하네요.
그리하여 세상 사람들은 상대방의 잘못을 찾아내는 데에는 기가 막히게 빠르지만, 제 자신의 결점들은 너무도 종종 못보고 넘어간다고 하네요.

257. 연못가의 수사슴


257. The Stag at the Pool
257. 연못가의 수사슴 (이솝 우화)
​

A STAG overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink. Seeing his own shadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the size and variety of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having such slender and weak feet. While he was thus contemplating himself, a Lion appeared at the pool and crouched to spring upon him. The Stag immediately took to flight, and exerting his utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion.
더위에 지친 수사슴이 연못가로 물을 마시러 왔다, 물에 비친 자신의 모습을 보곤 뻑이 가 버렸어요. 큰 덩치며 다양한 크기의 뿔들이며 정말이지 어느 거 하나 칭찬안할 게 없었죠.
근데 자신의 가느다랗고 약해보이는 다리는 여간 기분 나쁘지 않았어요.
그가 그렇게 자신의 모습에 반해 중얼중얼 거리고 있는 사이에, 사자가 연못가에 왔다 그를 발견하곤 당장 달려들었어요.
수사슴은 즉시 힘차게 달아났어요. 초스피드로 말이죠. 평평한 땅에선 달아나기가 한껏 쉬웠어요. 모든 게 뻥 뚫려 있었으니까요, 그래서 사자와의 거리도 충분히 안전할 정도로까지 멀어지게 되었답니다.
​
​
But entering a wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly came up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached himself: “Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet which would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers which have proved my destruction.”
What is most truly valuable is often underrated.
그런데 숲으로 들어오자마자 수사슴의 뿔들이 그만 나뭇가지들과 뒤엉켰지 뭐예요, 그 바람에 잽싸게 쫓아온 사자가 달려들어 수사슴을 잡아버렸죠.
후회해도 너무도 늦었을 때 수사슴이 스스로를 질책하며 말했어요.
“난 이래도 싸! 내 자신을 속이다니! 날 살려준 다리를 멸시하고, 날 재앙에 빠뜨린 이 거추장스러운 뿔을 찬송하다니.”
진실로 가치 있는 것이 멸시받을 때가 현실에선 너무도 많죠.

​

A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, which had produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that the figs would ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the reason of his doing so, said to him, “You are indeed, sir, sadly deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you, but which will never reward you with enjoyment.”
반쯤 굶은 갈까마귀가 무화과나무에 자리를 잡고 앉았어요. 때는 무화과가 생길 때도 아닌데 말이죠. 그래도 갈까마귀는 무화과들이 얼른 익기를 바라며 무진장 기다리고 있었답니다.
한참을 앉아 있다 이 말 같지도 않은 이유를 알게 된 여우가 갈까마귀에게 말했어요.
“너 정말 어처구니가 없구나. 스스로를 헛된 희망으로 속이다니, 하지만 그게 네 배를 실질적으로 채워주진 못한다고.”

259. 아빠를 묻어드린 종달새


259. The Lark Burying Her Father
259. 아빠를 묻어드린 종달새 (이솝 우화)
​

THE LARK (according to an ancient legend) was created before the earth itself, and when her father died, as there was no earth, she could find no place of burial for him. She let him lie uninterred for five days, and on the sixth day, not knowing what else to do, she buried him in her own head. Hence she obtained her crest, which is popularly said to be her father’s grave-hillock.
Youth’s first duty is reverence to parents.
고대 전설에 따르면 종달새는 흙이 생기기 전에 창조되었데요.
그래서 종달새의 아빠가 돌아가셨을 때 종달새로선 아빠를 묻어드릴 땅이 없었어요. 또한 묻어드릴 장소도 찾을 수 없었지요.
그래서 그녀(종달새)는 자신의 아빠를 5일 동안 눕혀놓아야만 했어요. 그러다 6일째가 된 날 도무지 별다른 수가 없어 그녀는 아빠를 자신의 머리속에다 묻어드렸어요.
그때부터 종달새들은 갓털(머리 위로 난 털)을 지니고 태어나게 되었고 그게 아빠의 무덤이란 게 널리 알려지게 된 거지요.

Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors.
모기가 황소의 뿔에 앉아 한참을 머물렀어요.
모기가 다시 날아오르기 직전 윙윙 거리는 목소리로 말했어요.
“어이, 내가 가 봐도 되겠니?”
황소가 대꾸했어요.
“오는 줄도 몰랐는데 뭘, 네가 그냥 갔어도 난 눈치 채지 못했을 거야.”

A BITCH, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place where she might litter. When her request was granted, she besought permission to rear her puppies in the same spot. The shepherd again consented. But at last the Bitch, protected by the bodyguard of her Whelps, who had now grown up and were able to defend themselves, asserted her exclusive right to the place and would not permit the shepherd to approach.
어미 개가 출산할 때가 되자 “짚을 깔고 누울 수 있는 장소를 마련해달라”고 양치기에게 간절히 빌었어요.
그녀의 청을 들어주자, 어미 개는 이번엔 “같은 장소에서 제 새끼들을 키울 수 있게 허락해 달라”고 애원했어요.
양치기는 이번에도 그녀의 바람을 들어주었어요.
하지만 그 새끼들이 다 자라 든든한 보디가드들이 되어주고 스스로들을 방어할 수 있게 되자, 어미 개는 노골적으로 “우리만 여기 머물 독점적 권리가 있어”라며 더는 더 양치기가 오는 것을 허락하지 않았답니다.

The Sheep eating the acorns inadvertently frayed and tore the cloak. When the Shepherd came down and saw what was done, he said, “O you most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make garments for all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds you.”

AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day, was greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly besought her to stop chirping. The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped louder and louder the more the Owl entreated. When she saw that she could get no redress and that her words were despised, the Owl attacked the chatterer by a stratagem. “Since I cannot sleep,” she said, “on account of your song which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me. If you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together.” The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her voice, eagerly flew up. The Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to death.
부엉이는 밤에 먹고 낮에 자는 새지요. 근데 이놈의 메뚜기가 찡찡 울어대는 통에 부엉이가 도무지 잠을 잘 수 없는 거 있죠.
부엉이는 “제발 그쳐 달라” 부탁했지만 소용없었어요. 메뚜기는 더 크고 크게 찡찡 울고 또 울어댔어요.
도무지 말이 통하지 않자, 부엉이는 이 수다쟁이를 꾀로 공격하기로 결심했어요.
“어찌나 네 목소리가 듣기 좋은지,”라며 부엉이가 말했어요. “잠도 오지 않는 거 있지. 네 노래는 아폴로의 리라(사진링크 ▶ https://goo.gl/VF63uU . 리라는 고대 그리스의 하프임) 만큼이나 달콤해. 그래서 말인데, 내가 최근에 아테네 여신한테서 신주(술)를 조금 얻었거든. 만약 너만 괜찮다면 우리 집에 와서 같이 마시자구나.”
그렇지 않아도 목이 말랐던 메뚜기는 자신의 목소리 칭찬에 흠뻑 취해 단번에 뛰어나왔어요.

The Camel, envious of the praises bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to divert to himself the favor of the guests, proposed to stand up in his turn and dance for their amusement. He moved about in so utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a fit of indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the assembly.

​

A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as sacred, took great care of it.
Self-interest alone moves some men.
농부의 마당에 사과나무 하나가 있었는데, 그 나무는 전혀 열매를 맺지 않았어요. 그냥 참새들과 메뚜기들의 안식처가 되어주는 게 다였답니다.
농부가 나무를 베어내기로 결심하고 손에 도끼를 쥐고 아랫부분을 세차게 내려쳤어요.
메뚜기들과 참새들이 우르르 몰려나와선 “제발 이 나무를 배지 말아줘요, 여긴 저희의 집이거든요, 베지 않고 놓아두시면 저희들도 계속 머물 수 있고 그럼 아저씨도 일하시다 저희 노랫소리 덕분에 기운을 차릴 수 있어요.”
말 같지도 않은 소리에 전혀 개의치 않고 농부는 두 번째로 그 나무를 내리치고 세 번째로 내리쳤어요.
그때 도끼날이 나무 속 빈 공간에 닿았는데, 그게 알고 보니 꿀이 가득 찬 벌집이었던 거예요.
바로 이 꿀을 맛보고 나서야 그제야 농부가 도끼를 내려놓으며 사과나무를 신성시하며 잘 돌봐주었답니다.

TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber. The one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his stout right hand. The Robber being slain, the timid companion ran up and drew his sword, and then, throwing back his traveling cloak said, “I’ll at him, and I’ll take care he shall learn whom he has attacked.”
두 병사가 함께 여행을 하다 강도와 맞닿트렸어요.
병사 하나는 잽싸게 도망쳤지만, 나머지 한 병사는 굳건히 서서 자신의 억센 오른손으로 방어를 하였더랬죠.
강도가 죽자, 겁 많은 동료 또한 뛰어오더니 검을 빼들어 마구 찌르더니 말했어요.
“이놈, 내가 맡아주지, 내가 누군지 알게 될 게다.”
​

On this, he who had fought with the Robber made answer, “I only wish that you had helped me just now, even if it had been only with those words, for I should have been the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now put up your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue, till you can deceive others who do not know you. I, indeed, who have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well that no dependence can be placed on your valor.”
그러자 실제 강도와 싸워 이긴 병사가 말했어요.
“자네가 좀 전 그런 말이라도 해서 나를 도왔더라면 훨씬 더 수월했을 텐데. 방금 한 말이 사실이라면 말이네. 이제 됐으니 검을 거두게, 마찬가지로 아무짝에도 소용없던 입도 다물게나. 남은 속일지 몰라도, 자네가 토끼는(달아나는) 걸 내 두 눈으로 다 본 이상 자네 용맹에 대한 어떤 변명들도 소용없다네.”

THE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of certain trees to be under their special protection. Jupiter chose the oak, Venus the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and Hercules the poplar. Minerva, wondering why they had preferred trees not yielding fruit, inquired the reason for their choice. Jupiter replied, “It is lest we should seem to covet the honor for the fruit.” But said Minerva, “Let anyone say what he will the olive is more dear to me on account of its fruit.” Then said Jupiter, “My daughter, you are rightly called wise; for unless what we do is useful, the glory of it is vain.”
고대 전설에 의하면, 신들은 자신들이 특별히 보호하며 돌봐줄 특정 나무(=신목=수호신나무)를 선택하기로 했데요.
제우스신은 참나무를 골랐고요, 비너스 여신은 도금양(늘푸른 떨기나무. 사진링크▶ https://goo.gl/arnwt2 )을 골랐고요, 아폴로신은 월계수나무를 골랐고요, 키벨레(대지의 여신)는 소나무를 골랐고요, 헤라클레스는 포플러 나무를 골랐데요.
그러자 아테네 여신이 궁금해 했어요.
“왜 다들 열매를 맺지도 않는 나무들을 선호하시는 거죠, 이유가 뭔가요?”
제우스신이 대답했어요.
“열매를 훔쳐 그 영광을 훔치려할 게 아니냐.”
하지만 아테네 여신은 말했죠.
“제 신목인 올리브 열매 덕분에 사람들이 저를 더 숭상하잖아요.”
그러자 제우스신이 말했어요.
“역시나 넌 내 딸이다, 참 지혜롭구나. 소용이 없다면 영광도 헛되겠지.”

A FAMISHED WOLF was prowling about in the morning in search of food. As he passed the door of a cottage built in the forest, he heard a Mother say to her child, “Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the window, and the Wolf shall eat you.” The Wolf sat all day waiting at the door. In the evening he heard the same woman fondling her child and saying: “You are quiet now, and if the Wolf should come, we will kill him.” The Wolf, hearing these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger. When he reached his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned wearied and supperless, so contrary to his wont. He replied: “Why, forsooth! use I gave credence to the words of a woman!”
굶주린 늑대가 아침에 먹이를 찾아 헤매고(배회하고) 있었어요.
때마침 숲속에 지어진 오두막 문 앞을 지나가다 아기엄마가 아이에게 이렇게 말하는 걸 듣게 되었죠.

늑대는 문 앞에서 하루 종일 기다렸어요.
저녁이 되자 아이를 귀여워하는 똑같은 여성의 말이 들려왔어요.
“에구 에구 착한 것, 참 조용하네, 걱정마렴, 늑대가 오면 아빠 엄마가 늑대를 죽여버릴 테니.”
이 말에 늑대가 방향을 돌려 집으로 돌아갔지요. 추위와 배고픔에 숨을 헐떡거리면서 말이죠.
늑대가 자신의 굴에 도착하자, 아내 늑대가 “왜 이리 늦게까지 밥도 못 먹고 돌아온 거예요?”라고 말했어요.
늑대가 대답했어요.
“말마, 원 세상에! 한 입으로 두 말하는 걸 믿은 내가 바보지!”

270. 당나귀와 말


270. The Ass and the Horse
270. 당나귀와 말 (이솝 우화)
​

AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed. “Yes,” said the Horse; “if any remains out of what I am now eating I will give it you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you will come when I reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a little sack full of barley.” The Ass replied, “Thank you. But I can’t think that you, who refuse me a little matter now. will by and by confer on me a greater benefit.”
당나귀가 자신이 받는 음식량이 적다며 말에게 음식을 조금만 떼어달라고 간청했어요.
“그래,”라며 말이 말했어요. “지금 먹는 게 남으면 네게 줄게, 그리고 네가 저녁에 우리 마구간에 오겠다면 그때 내 보리도 좀 줄게.”
당나귀가 대꾸했어요.
“고마워, 하지만 내가 보기에 넌 그럴 마음이 없어 보이네, 지금 조금 주겠다는 게 아니라 나중에 많이 주겠다는 네 말이 영 와 닿지가 않아서 말이요.”

A WAYFARING MAN, traveling in the desert, met a woman standing alone and terribly dejected. He inquired of her, “Who art thou?” “My name is Truth,” she replied. “And for what cause,” he asked, “have you left the city to dwell alone here in the wilderness?” She made answer, “Because in former times, falsehood was with few, but is now with all men.”
나그네가 황무지 벌판을 지나가고 있는데 낙담한 체 홀로 서 있는 여인과 마주쳤어요.
나그네가 물었죠.
“당신은 누구십니까?”
“제 이름은 ‘진실’입니다.”라며 그녀가 대답했어요.
“어인 이유로,”라며 나그네가 물었어요. “이렇게 도시에서 멀리 떨어진 황무지에 홀로 머물고 계신 겁니까?”
그녀가 대답했어요.
“전에는 도시에 ‘거짓’의 수가 적었는데, 지금은 모든 사람들이 ‘거짓’과만 어울리려해 이리되었습니다.”

272. 살인자와 나일 강 (이솝 우화)
​

A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the man whom he murdered. On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on its bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he threw himself into the river, where a crocodile caught him and ate him. Thus the earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a murderer.
살인을 저지른 한 남성이 희생자의 가족으로부터 추격을 받고 있었어요.
그가 나일 강에 도착해보니 강둑에 사자가 나타나 “어흥!”하고 위협을 했어요, 그가 나무로 올라가 피했더니 이번엔 나뭇가지에 있던 독사가 “슈슈!”하며 크게 위협하는 바람에, 그가 강으로 뛰어내렸는데, 강에 있던 악어가 그를 잡아먹어버렸어요.
역시나 살인자에겐, 하늘이든 땅이든 안식처는 없는 법이랍니다.

​

A FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of becoming his servant. Each undertook his proper duty in accordance with his own nature and powers. The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey; the Lion sprang on it and seized it. The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion carrying off the Lion’s share, and said that he would no longer find out the prey, but would capture it on his own account. The next day he attempted to snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell prey to the huntsmen and hounds.
여우가 사자와 파트너십(동반자) 관계를 맺고 그의 부하가 되기로 했어요.
각자 힘과 본성에 따른 자기 일이 있었는데, 여우가 사냥감을 발견하고 손가락으로 가리키면 사자가 냉큼 달려가 붙잡는 방식이었죠.
여우는 곧 질투심을 느끼게 되었어요, 사자가 자기 몫으로 훨씬 더 많이 가져갔기 때문이지요.
그래서 여우는 “더는 당신을 위해 먹이를 찾기 않겠어요. 이제 혼자 찾아보시라고요.”라고 말했어요.
다음날 여우는 양우리에 있던 새끼 양을 훔치려다 그만 반대로 자신이 사냥꾼들과 사냥개들의 먹잇감이 되고 말았답니다.

276. 어릿광대와 촌뜨기


276. The Buffoon and the Countryman
276. 어릿광대와 촌뜨기 (이솝 우화)
​

A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people, and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who invented a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers contended for the prize. Among them came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been brought out on any stage before. This report being spread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part.
부유한 귀족이 한번은, 사람들에게 공짜로 야외극장을 크게 열고는 다음과 같이 알렸어요.
“누구든 색다른 재미를 선사해주는 자에겐 큰 보답을 하리라.”
수많은 대중연예인들이 상을 타기 위해 모여들었지요.
그들 중엔 이미 웃음으로 평판이 자자한 어릿광대도 한 명 있었답니다.
어릿광대가 말했어요.
“일찍이 무대에서 보인 적이 없는 새로운 오락을 선사하겠소.”
이 소문이 쫙 퍼지면서 일대는 흥이 장난이 아니었어요, 야외극장은 말 그대로 인산인해를 이루었지요.
​

The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out. When that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause.
다른 기계장치나 도우미도 없이 그 어릿광대가 무대로 오르자 좌중은 그야말로 기대감으로 쥐죽은 듯 조용해졌지요.
순간 그가 고개를 가슴께로 푹 쑥이더니 새끼 돼지가 꿀꿀 우는 소리를 너무도 잘 흉내 냈기에, 관객들이 “당신 외투 속에 새끼돼지를 숨겨놓고 있는 거 아냐! 외투를 펄럭여보라고!”라며 아우성들을 쳐댔어요.
어릿광대가 하란 대로 했음에도 아무 것도 안 보이자, 사람들은 “진정한 배우!”라며 우레와 같은 박수갈채를 보내주었지요.
​
​
A Countryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, “So help me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!” and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman than to see the spectacle. Both of the performers appeared on the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators.
관객들 중에는 촌뜨기도 있었는데 그는 돌아가는 걸 잘 봐두었다가 이렇게 말했어요.
“맹세코, 저딴 건 나도 하겠다!”
그 즉시 그가 선포했어요.
“내일 똑같은 걸 제가 연기해보겠소! 훨씬 더 리얼하게(현실감 있게) 말이오.”
다음날 훨씬 더 많은 관객들이 야외극장으로 모여들었어요. 하지만 사람들이 모인 이유는 촌뜨기가 흉내를 잘 내는 걸 보려는 게 아니라 못하는 걸 보고 놀려주기 위함이었죠.
무대 위로 어릿광대와 촌뜨기가 모습을 드러냈어요.
어릿광대가 먼저 꿀꿀 소리를 내더니 꽥꽥 쥐어짜는 소리를 기가 막히게 흉내 냈기에 어제와 같이 우레와 같은 박수소리가 터져 나왔어요.
​
​
Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. On this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake. “Look here,” he said, “this shows what sort of judges you are.”
다음으로 촌뜨기 차례가 되었어요.
촌뜨기는 무대에 오르기 전 옷 속에 정말로 새끼 돼지를 숨겨놓고 올라왔어요. 물론 그렇게 하리라곤 관객들은 전혀 생각도 못했고 말이죠.
촌뜨기가 새끼 돼지의 귀를 사정없이 움켜쥐자 새끼 돼지가 꽥꽥 비명을 질러댔어요.
너무도 리얼했기에 사람들은 “어랫광대가 한 거보다 훨씬 더 리얼해. 훨씬 스릴 있었다고, 와!”하며 아우성을 쳐댔지요.
바로 그때 촌뜨기가 옷 속에 감추고 있던 새끼 돼지를 꺼내 들며 사람들의 판정이 얼마나 명백한 실수인지 증거로 들이밀었지요.
“보시오들,”라며 촌뜨기가 말했어요. “당신들이 무슨 판정을 했는지 이게 증명하고 있소이다.”

In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: “O unhappy me! who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction.”
배가 너무 고프던 까마귀가 볕(햇볕)이 드는 구석에 가만히 누워 있던 뱀을 보곤 날름 내려와 탐욕스럽게 움켜 쥐었어요.
순간 몸을 튼 뱀이 까마귀를 콱 무는 바람에 까마귀의 몸에 치명적인 독이 퍼졌어요.
죽음의 기로에 선 새가 탄식하며 말했어요.

A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders and set out homewards. On his way he met a man on horseback who begged the hare of him, under the pretense of purchasing it. However, when the Horseman got the hare, he rode off as fast as he could. The Hunter ran after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman increased more and more the distance between them. The Hunter, sorely against his will, called out to him and said, “Get along with you! for I will now make you a present of the hare.”
어떤 사냥꾼이 잡은 산토끼를 어깨에 얹고 의기양양 집으로 향하고 있었어요.
가다가 ‘말을 탄 사람’을 만났는데 “그 토끼를 사겠소.”라며 거짓으로 연기하며 넘겨달라는 거예요.

산토끼를 받자마자 ‘말을 탄 사람’은 최대한 빨리 말을 타고 달아나버렸어요.
사냥꾼이 뒤쫓아가봤지만 거리차이는 점점 멀어질 뿐이었어요.
이젠 의지와 상관없이 따라잡을 수 없을 정도로까지 ‘말을 탄 사람’이 달아나자, 사냥꾼이 뒤에서 고레고레 고함을 쳤어요.

279. 왕자님과 사자그림


279. The King’s Son and the Painted Lion
279. 왕자님과 사자그림 (이솝 우화)
​

A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a lion. When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: “O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my father’s, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what shall I now do to you?’
용감한 운동을 엄청 좋아하는 외동아들을 둔 왕이 하루는 꿈에 자기 아들이 사자 때문에 죽는 경고성 꿈을 꾸고 화들짝 놀라고 말았지요.
꿈이 너무도 생생한데 놀란 왕은 즉시 아들이 안전하게 머물 궁전을 만들어주고, 궁전의 벽들을 다양한 크기의 동물들로 그림을 그려놓아 아들이 지루해하지 않도록 신경 썼어요.
그 중에는 사자 그림도 있었답니다.
혈기왕성한 왕자가 이 사자그림을 보곤, 신선한 바깥공기도 못 쐬고 안에만 있어야 하는 게 사자 때문인 거에 분개해 사자 가까이로 가 말했지요.
“오 이 파렴치한 동물 같으니! 네 놈이 내 아빠의 꿈에 들이 닫치는 바람에 나만 이 외딴 궁전 속에 갇혀 있지 않니. 그래 내가 네 놈을 어떻게 해줄까?”
​
​
With these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion. But one of the tree’s prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he died not many days later.
We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them.
이 말을 하며 왕자가 가시나무로 손을 뻗었어요, 나뭇가지를 꺾어 몽둥이 대신 이 사자를 흠뻑 때려줄 참이었지요.
하지만 나무의 가시 하나가 왕자의 손가락에 깊이 박히는 바람에 너무 고통을 동반한 고름이 생기고 말았어요.
그 바람에 젊은 왕자는 컨디션이 좋지 않아 몸져눕게 되었고, 곧 폭풍과도 같은 고열이 그를 덮쳐 며칠 후 그를 하늘나라로 데려가고 말았답니다.
아셨죠, 피할 수 없을 땐 참고 견디는 거만한 게 없답니다.

A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to change her into the form of a woman. Venus consented to her request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride. While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change of shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room. The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it. Venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape.
Nature exceeds nurture.
암고양이가 잘생긴 청년을 보고 한눈에 반해버리고 말았어요. 그래서 비너스 여신을 찾아가 “인간의 여자로 만들어주세요.”라고 빌고 또 빌었어요.
비너스가 그녀의 소원을 들어주어 그녀를 아름다운 처녀로 만들어주었답니다. 어찌나 예뻤던지 그 젊은이 또한 그녀를 보고 사랑에 빠져 신부로 맞이하였지요.
그 둘이 침대에 누워 있을 때, 비너스 여신은 고양이가 자신의 습관을 인간으로 잘 바꾸었는지를 알고 싶어, 방 한가운데에 생쥐 한 마리를 내려놓았지요.
그 순간 고양이는 현재의 신분을 까마득히 잊고선 침대에서 냉큼 뛰어내려 생쥐를 뒤쫓기 시작했어요. 잡아먹으려고 말이죠.
이에 너무도 실망한 비너스 여신이 고양이를 다시 원래의 모습(고양이)으로 되돌려놓고 말았답니다.

A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collected round a well, talking and laughing. “Look there,” cried one of them, “did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?’ The old man hearing this, quickly made his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side. Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate.
방앗간 주인과 아들이 그들의 당나귀를 인근 시장에 내다 팔려고 데리고 가고 있었어요.
채 미쳐 멀리 못가서 그들은 우물가에서 물을 퍼담고 있는 한 무리의 여인들을 만나게 되었지요.
그녀들은 연신 웃으며 이렇게 말했어요.
“저기 좀 봐, 어쩜 저리 어리석은 사람들이 다 있담, 타고 가면 될 것을 무거운 발걸음으로 터벅터벅 걷고 있잖아?”

Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs.” Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children: “Why, you lazy old fellow,” cried several tongues at once, “how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?’
“저거 좀 봐,”라며 노인들 중 한 명이 말했어요. “속담에 틀린 말이 하나도 없다니까. 요즘 노인들이 얼마나 존경을 못 받고 있는지 여실히 드러내고 있어? 연로한 아빠는 걸어가고 젊디 젊은 자식 놈은 당나귀를 타고 가네? 이 젊은 개구쟁이야, 얼른 내려오지 못해, 어서 네 아빠를 태우지 못해.”
이 말에 늙은 아빠는 얼른 아들을 내리곤 자신이 당나귀 등에 올라탔지요.
그건 오래가지 못했어요. 왜냐면 곧 그들은 한 무리의 엄마와 아이들을 만났기 때문이지요.
“어쩜, 저리 게으른 아빠가 다 있담,”라며 여기저기서 여인들의 탄식이 흘러나왔어요. “자기는 당나귀 등에 타고 가고, 어린 아들은 그 옆에서 발검음도 못 맞춰서 어렵게 걷고 있으니 말이야?”
​
​
The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. “Pray, honest friend,” said a citizen, “is that Ass your own?’ “Yes,” replied the old man. “O, one would not have thought so,” said the other, “by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you.” “Anything to please you,” said the old man; “we can but try.” So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town.
원체 마음 착한 방앗간 주인은 즉시 자기 아들도 들어 자기 뒤에 태웠지요.
그들이 거의 도시에 다다랐을 무렵에.
“이보게들,”라며 시민 한 사람이 말했어요. “그 당나귀 당신들 거요?”
“네.”라며 늙은 아빠가 대꾸했어요.
“오, 그런데도 타고 간단 말이오,”라며 다른 시민도 덩달아 말했어요. “아무도 당신들 당나귀라 여기지 않을 게오. 차라리 당신들 두 사람이 그 불쌍한 짐승을 들고서 가는 게 더 낫겠소 그래.”
“그럼 뭐,”라며 늙은 아빠가 말했어요. “당장 그리 하리다.”
그리하여 아빠는 아들과 함께 당나귀에서 내려 당나귀 다리들을 한데 묶은 다음 장대(긴 막대기) 하나에 꽂아 둘이 어깨에 나눠 들고 도시로 들어가는 다리를 건너고 있었답니다.
​
​
This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.
이 광경을 보고 사람들이 여기저기서 박장대소를 터뜨렸고, 그 소란과 자신(당나귀)을 대하는 이 낮선 방식이 그렇지 않아도 마음에 들지 않던 당나귀가 끈을 끊고 장대(긴 막대기)에서 내려오려 버둥대다 그만 강물 속에 빠지고 말았어요.
그러자 늙은 아빠는 속 타고 창피해 집으로 줄행랑을 치며 ‘모두를 만족시키려다가는 결국 아무도 만족시키지 못한다!’는 교훈을 얻은 것에 만족해야했지요.
하지만 팔려던 당나귀를 이미 잃은 후였답니다.

284. The Crow and the Sheep
284. 까마귀와 양 (이솝 우화)
​

A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep. The Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time, and at last said, “If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth.” To this the Crow replied, “I despise the weak and yield to the strong. I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter; and I thus prolong my life to a good old age.”
꼴통(다루기 힘든) 까마귀가 양의 등에 자리를 잡고 앉아버렸답니다.
그리하여 양은 자신의 의지에 반하게 등에 까마귀를 얹고 한참을 돌아다니게 되었다.
나중에 안 양이 말했어요.
“나니까 가만있지, 만약 네가 개의 등에 이딴 식으로 앉았더라면 그 날카로운 이빨들에 아작이 났을 거야.”
이에 까마귀가 대꾸했어요.
“난 약자에겐 강하지만 강자에겐 숙일 줄 안다고. 누굴 못 살게 굴고 누구에겐 아첨을 해야하는지 난 알아. 그러니 난 아마 아주 아주 오래 살 거야.”

A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught hold of a Bramble to save himself. Having pricked and grievously tom the soles of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to her for assistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself. The Bramble, interrupting him, said, “But you really must have been out of your senses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed to fasten upon others.”
여우가 산울타리를 오르다 그만 발을 헛디디는 바람에 순간 안 넘어지려고 가시나무를 힘껏 움켜쥐고 말았어요.
여우의 발바닥은 가시에 찔려 퉁퉁 붓고 말았어요.
여우가 가시나무에게 화를 내며 말했어요.
“도와달라고 손을 내밀었더니 어떻게 산울타리보다 더 내게 험한 짓을 하는 거니.”
가시나무가 여우의 말을 제지하며 말했지요.
“난 원래 항상 남을 찔러, 그런 날 움켜쥔 네가 살짝 맛이 갔던 건 아니니.”

Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, “You have unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!” To which the Lion jeeringly replied, “It was righteously yours, eh? The gift of a friend?’

A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth to its widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it to be an egg. Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he said, “I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything round must be an egg.”
They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into unsuspected danger.

AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The Ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches. The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove take wing.
개미가 목을 축이려고 강둑엘 갔다 그만 물살에 휘감겨 빠져 죽기 일보 직전이었어요.

곧이어 새잡이가 오더니 나무 아래에 서선 새잡는 끈끈이를 바른 나뭇가지로 비둘기를 잡으려했어요. 비둘기가 나뭇가지에 앉아 있었거든요.
새잡이의 의도를 간파한 개미가 그의 발을 콱 깨물었어요.

​

SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom they stole, and got off as fast as they could. Upon arriving at home they prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: “Pray spare me; I am very serviceable to men. I wake them up in the night to their work.” “That is the very reason why we must the more kill you,” they replied; “for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our business.”
The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions.

“절 놓아주세요. 전 사람들에게 도움이 된다고요. 당신들의 잠을 깨워 일터로 보내거든요.”
“바로 그 이유 때문에 우리가 널 잡으려는 거다.”라며 그들이 대답했어요. “네가 시도 때도 없이 사람들을 깨우는 바람에 우리의 도둑질들이 거들 나게 생겼단 말이다.”

292. 개와 요리사


292. The Dog and the Cook
292. 개와 요리사 (이솝 우화)
​

A RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, “My master gives a feast, and there is always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight.” The Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the preparations for so grand an entertainment, said in the joy of his heart, “How glad I am that I came! I do not often get such a chance as this. I will take care and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow.”
부자가 큰 잔치를 열었어요. 친구들과 지인들을 왕창 초대했죠.
그의 개도 또한 흥이 나 자기 친구인 개를 손님으로 초대하며 말했어요.
“내 주인이 잔치를 여는데 음식이 엄청 남아돌 거야, 그러니 너도 와서 나랑 밤새껏 배터지게 먹어보자.”
그 개 또한 초대를 마다할 이유가 없었기에 약속된 시간에 도착했지요.
잔치 준비가 한창이라 음식들이 즐비하게 놓여 있는 것에 마음이 붕 뜬 친구 개가 말했어요.
“오길 정말 잘 했어! 횡재가 따로 없네, 오늘 내일 아주 그냥 끝장이 나도록 먹어봐야지.”
​

While he was congratulating himself and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the window. He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other street dogs, who came up to him and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper. He replied, “Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much wine that I remember nothing. I do not know how I got out of the house.”
친구 개가 그렇게 기뻐하며 꼬리를 막 흔들며 기쁜 표정을 친구에게 전하고 있는데, 때마침 요리사가 음식들 사이로 ‘쓰잘머리’(=쓸모) 없이 돌아다니고 있던 친구 개를 발견하곤 앞뒤 발을 움켜잡곤 창문 밖으로 그냥 사정없이 내던져버렸어요.
바닥에 엄청 세게 떨어진 친구 개는 몹시 울부짖으며 다리까지 절뚝거리면서 떠났답니다.
그 울부짖음이 다른 거리의 개들의 이목을 끌었고, 그들이 “그래 어땠어? 저녁이 어떻데? 맛있어요?”라고 물었어요.
그가 대꾸했답니다.
“음, 근데 정말, 어찌나 포도주를 마셔댔는지 내가 그 집에서 어떻게 나왔는지조차 하나도 기억 안나는 거 있지.”

​

TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer’s sun, laid themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree. As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers said to the other, “What a singularly useless tree is the Plane! It bears no fruit, and is not of the least service to man.” The Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, “You ungrateful fellows! Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?’
Some men underrate their best blessings.
여름 태양의 무더위에 완전히 녹초가 돼버린 두 여행자가 낮12시쯤에 플라타너스(나무이름. 사진링크 ▶ https://goo.gl/hl8OXF ) 나뭇가지들이 널찍이 퍼진 그늘 아래로 가 드러누웠어요.
그렇게 휴식을 취하던 둘 중 한 명이 상대방에게 말했어요.
“플라타너스도 참 쓸모없는 나무야 그치! 열매도 안 맺어, 그렇다고 사람에게 도움이 되길 해.”
‘빡 친’(화가 난) 플라타너스가 중간에 끼어들며 말했어요.
“이 배은망덕한 자슥들아! 뭐가 어째, 지금 너희들이 누구 그늘에서 누워 휴식을 취하고 있다고 생각하는 거야, 그런데도 뭐 내가 도움이 안 된다고, 쓸모가 없다고?”

THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below. As they scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety. On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares cried out to his companions: “Stay, my friends, do not do as you intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still more timid than ourselves.”
과도한 겁먹음과 지속적인 깜짝깜짝 놀람들에 지친 산토끼들이 합심해 “이렇게 살 바에 차라리 높은 바위에서 다 같이 깊은 연못 속으로 뛰어들어 죽자 죽어!”라고 결정하기에 이르렀어요.
결심을 실행에 옮기기 위해 산토끼들이 한꺼번에 우르르 달려갔는데, 때마침 연못가에 앉아 있던 개구리들이 산토끼들의 발자국 소리를 듣곤 화들짝 놀라 위험을 피해 깊은 물속으로 피신하고 말았어요.
개구리들이 재빨리 도망치는 것을 본 산토끼들 중 한 명이 친구들에게 소리쳤어요.
“멈춰, 친구들아, 이럴 일이 아냐, 우리보다 훨씬 더 겁 많은 동물이 저기 있잖니.”

295. 사자와 제우스와 코끼리


295. The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant
295. 사자와 제우스와 코끼리 (이솝 우화)
​

THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. “It is true, O Jupiter!” he said, “that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape, and powerful in attack. I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be frightened by the crowing of a cock.” Jupiter replied, “Why do you blame me without a cause? I have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and your courage never fails you except in this one instance.” On hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and, reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die.
사자가 불만이 이만저만이 아니었어요, 누구에게는요, 제우스 신에게지요.
“저는 이렇게 덩치가 크고 멋지고 파워풀하고 강력한 발톱과 이빨과 발로 온 숲의 동물들 위에 군림하는데,”라며 사자가 말했어요. “제우스신이시여, 참말로 왜 이런 제가 불명예스럽게도 수탉 울음소리만 들으면 기겁을 하는 건데요. 제가 왜 겁쟁이가 되어야하냐고요!”
제우스가 대답했어요.
“왜 내게 하소연을 하는 게냐? 널 만들 때 내(제우스) 자신이 소유한 모든 재능들을 네게 주지 않았더냐, 그리하여 딱 한 가지 빼고는 어떤 것도 네 용기를 굴복시킬 수 없느니라.”
이 설명을 듣고서도 사자는 으르렁거리며 한탄을 했어요.
“이런 겁쟁이로 사느니 죽는 게 나아.”
​
​
As these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him. After a time he observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then. Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, “Do you see that little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed. I should die presently.” The Lion said, “Well, since so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself dead. I find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.”
사자가 이런 생각들에 취해있을 때 때마침 코끼리를 만나 대화를 나누게 되었어요.
잠시 후 사자는 코끼리가 아주 자주 자신의 귀를 흔드는 것을 보곤, “뭔 문제 있어, 왜 그렇게 귀를 자주 흔드는 거니?”라고 물어보았어요.
때마침 모기 한 마리가 코끼리의 머리 위에 앉아 있었는데, 코끼리가 이렇게 대답했지요.
“윙윙거리는 이 작은 곤충 보이지? 이게 내 귀에 들어가면 내 운은 끝나. 내가 바로 죽게 되거든.”
사자가 말했어요.
“음, 이토록 거대한 짐승이 그깟 자그마한 모기 한 마리를 두려워하다니, 그에 비하면 난 불평할 거도 못 되네. 죽을 필요도 없겠어. 이젠 자신감을 되찾았거든. 내가 코끼리보다 훨씬 낫잖아.”

297. The Rich Man and the Tanner
297. 부자와 가죽상인 (이솝 우화)
​

A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away. The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would leave soon. But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no further complaints.
가죽상인(원문→무두장이. 모피의 털을 뽑고 가죽을 부드럽게 하는 사람) 집 옆에 사는 부자가 있었어요.
부자는 더는 이 불유쾌한 가죽 냄새를 견딜 수가 없어 자신의 이웃인 가죽상인보고 “이사 가라!”고 윽박지르고 있었어요.
그럴 때마다 가죽상인 차일피일 이사를 미루며 “곧 이사 갈 거요.”라는 말만 되풀이했지요.
그리하여 가죽상인은 계속 있고 시간은 점점 흐르자 부자는 그만 가죽 냄새에 익숙해져 아무런 불편을 느끼지 못하게 돼 더는 불평을 하지 않았다고 하네요.

298. 조난당한 남자와 바다


298. The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea
298. 조난당한 남자와 바다 (이솝 우화)
​

A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after his buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and looking upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches. He argued that it enticed men with the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and destroyed them. The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him: “Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into fury.”
조난당한 남자가 깊은 물살의 난타를 당한 후 정신을 잃었다 어느 해안가로 떠밀려 왔지요.
잠시 후 깨어난 그가 바다를 되돌아보며 쌍욕을 해대기 시작했어요.
“고요한 표정으로 사람들을 유혹해 항해하도록 하더니 그래 거친 파도로 사람들을 익사나시키냐!”
바다가 여인의 모습을 하고 나타나 말했어요.
“절 비난하지 마세요, 선하신 아저씨, 모두 바람 때문이에요. 저는 본성이 육지처럼 차분하고 쉽게 움직이지 않는데 반해, 바람이 불쑥 불쑥 저를 밀쳐 저러한 파도들을 생성해내고 저를 미쳐 날뛰도록 채찍을 가하는 거랍니다.”

299. 노새들과 강도들


299. The Mules and the Robbers
299. 노새들과 강도들 (이솝 우화)
​

TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along. One carried panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. The Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to his neck. His companion followed with quiet and easy step. All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and in the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain. The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his misfortunes. The other replied, “I am indeed glad that I was thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound.”
두 명 노새들이 양쪽 등에 짐을 가득 지고 터벅터벅 걸어가고 있었어요.
한 명의 노새 등에는 돈이 가득 들어 있었고요, 다른 노새 등에는 곡식이 가득 들어 있었지요.
값진 돈을 운반하는 노새는 가면서도 머리를 꼿꼿이 들고 마치 자긍심 가득한 표정으로 한 발 두 발 착착 내디디며 목에 힘까지 주며 걸어갔어요.
반면 그의 친구 노새는 말없이 따르고만 있었죠.
때마침 숨어있던 강도들이 일시에 들이 닫치더니 노새 주인을 때려눕히곤 돈을 나르던 노새를 칼로 찔러 쓰러뜨렸어요. 하지만 강도들은 곡식을 나르던 노새에게는 눈길 한 번 주지 않았죠.
불시에 이런 강도를 당하고 부상까지 입게 된 노새를 본 다른 노새가 말했어요.
“내가 하찮다고 여겨진 게 참말 다행이야 잃은 게 하나도 없으니 말이야, 만약 돈을 나르다 부상까지 입었으면 어찌할 뻔했어.”

300. 독사와 철공용줄


300. The Viper and the File
300. 독사와 철공용줄 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the means of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly addressed himself to a File, and asked of him the favor of a meal. The File replied, “You must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything in return.”
독사 한 마리가 대장간에 들어와 각 연장(대장간에서 사용하는 도구)들에게 “배가 고파서 그래 먹을 것 좀 주겠니.”라고 부탁하며 돌아다니고 있었어요.
독사는 특히 철공용줄(쇠붙이를 쓸거나 세울 때 사용하는 연장. 사진링크 ▶ https://goo.gl/7wKrOo )에게 거듭 하소연을 하며 음식을 조금만 나눠줄 것을 빌었지요.
철공용줄이 대답했어요.
“나한테 음식을 구걸하다니 너 정말 바보구나. 난 빼앗기만 하지 절대 누굴 돕는 사람이 아냐.”

301. 사자와 양치기


301. The Lion and the Shepherd
301. 사자와 양치기 (이솝 우화)
​

A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to say, “I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.” The Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest. Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned “to be cast to the Lions” as the punishment for his imputed crime.
사자가 숲을 돌아다니다 그만 가시나무를 밟고 말았어요.
곧 사자는 양치기에게 가 꼬리를 치며 아양을 떨었는데 이렇게 말하는 듯 보였어요.
“부탁드립니다, 당신의 도움이 필요해요.”
양치기가 용기를 내 그 야수를 조사해보니 정말 가시가 하나 박혀 있었어요.
양치기를 사자의 앞발을 자신의 무릎 위에 얹히곤 가시를 빼 주었어요.
고통에서 해방된 사자는 숲으로 돌아갔지요.
그 후 얼마 지나지 않아 양치기는 거짓 고소를 당해 감옥에 갇혀 “사자들에게 산체로 던져지는 벌”을 당하게 되었어요.
​

But when the Lion was released from his cage, he recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.
하지만 우리에서 나온 그 사자가 자신을 일찍이 치료해준 양치기를 알아보곤 공격하는 대신 다가가 자신의 발을 양치기 무릎에 얹었지요.
이 기이한 사건을 들은 왕은 그 사자도 다시 숲으로 풀어주었고, 또한 양치기의 죄도 용서해주고 다시 친구들에게로 보내주었답니다.

​

THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors. He went to Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns. Jupiter, vexed at his request because he was not satisfied with his size and strength of body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears.
황소의 멋진 뿔을 본 낙타가 부러운 나머지 자신도 그와 같은 뿔을 달고 싶어 제우스신께 가 “저도 저런 뿔을 주세요.”라고 탄원하기에 이르렀어요.
하지만 낙타가 자기 몸집과 힘에 만족 못하는 꼴이 참 짜증이 났던 제우스신은 뿔을 달라는 그 부탁을 들어주는 대신 그만 낙타가 원래 가지고 있던 귀 일부를 싹둑 잘라버렸답니다.

303. 표범과 양치기들


303. The Panther and the Shepherds
303. 표범과 양치기들 (이솝 우화)
​

A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The Shepherds discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him dead. The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps.
운 나쁘게도 표범(동물이름)이 구덩이에 빠지고 말았어요.
양치기들이 이를 보곤 막대기들과 돌멩이들이며 손에 집히는 건 뭐든 던지며 죽이려고 했어요. 반면 죽게 된 표범을 보고 동정심을 느낀 일부 양치기들은 음식을 던져주었답니다.
밤이 되자 양치기들 모두는 집으로 돌아가 전혀 위험하단 생각 없이 잘도 잤어요. 분명 아침에 가보면 그 표범이 죽어있을 거란 건 변함이 없었거든요.
하지만 구덩이 속에서 기운을 차린 표범은 혼자 힘으로 구덩이를 빠져나와 빠른 걸음으로 자기 굴로 피신할 수 있었지요.
​

After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for their lives. To them the Panther made this reply: “I remember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears. I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.”
며칠 후 완전히 기운을 차리고 나타난 표범이 가축을 죽이는 사태가 벌어졌어요. 게다가 표범은 자신을 공격했던 양치기들까지 사납게 죽이기 시작했어요.
생명의 위협을 느낀, 살아남은 양치기들은 자신의 가축들로 둥그렇게 원을 그리고 그 속에 위치해선 목숨만 살려 달라 빌었어요.
표범이 그들에게 말했어요.
“돌로 나를 죽이려던 자와 음식으로 나를 구해준 자들을 모두 기억한다. 그러니 두려움을 버려라. 내 복수는 오직 나를 해치려던 자들에게만 향하리라.”

​

AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without hard work. But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier mounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the very midst of the enemy. The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the battlefield. Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse.
당나귀가 말에게 축하의 말을 건넸어요.
“넌 극진한 대우와 많은 밥을 먹는데, 반면 난 밥도 제대로 못 먹고 맨날 힘든 일만 골라 하니.”
하지만 전쟁이 터지고, 중무장한 병사를 태우고 떠난 말은 전직 속으로 뛰어들다 큰 부상을 당해 전쟁터에서 숨을 거두고 말았죠.
이를 본 당나귀는 자신의 생각을 고쳐먹고 말들을 가엾게 여기게 되었답니다.

305. 독수리와 새잡이(포획자)

305. 독수리와 새잡이(포획자) (이솝 우화)
​

AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his wings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief. Later, another neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again. The Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an offering to his benefactor. A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, “Do not cultivate the favor of this man, but of your former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a second time of your wings.”
한번은 독수리가 새잡이에게 붙잡히고 말았는데, 새잡이는 즉시 독수리의 양 날개를 자르고 다른 새들과 함께 새장에 가둬버렸어요.
거기서 독수리는 상심한 채 지내야했죠.
후에 이웃 주민이 그 독수리를 사갔는데 그는 독수리의 깃털들이 다시 자라게 풀어놓아주었죠.
독수리는 비행을 했다가 산토끼 한 마리를 낚아채 즉시 은인(독수리를 산 이웃주민)에게 가져다주며 은혜에 보답했어요.
이를 본 여우가 한탄하듯 말했어요.
“네가 선물을 드려야할 사람은 이 사람이 아니라 새잡이야, 그래야 새잡이가 독수리를 잡았을 때 다신 네 날개를 떼어내지 않을 거 아니니.”

Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, “You who have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?’ The Bald Man replied, “I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was no intention to hurt. But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had incurred a heavier penalty.”
대머리 신사가 앉아 있는데, 파리가 신사의 머리를 콱 깨물었지 뭐예요, 파리를 죽이려고 남자는 “철썩”하고 손바닥으로 자기 머리를 때렸죠.
유유히 날아오르며 파리가 남자를 비웃으며 말했어요.
“복수는 개뿔, 이렇게 작고 연약한 곤충을 죽이려 드시다니, 그렇담 당신 손바닥으로 머리를 때린 건 어떻게 보복하시려나?”
대머리 신사가 대답했어요.
“그야 상관 안하지, 애초 내겐 나쁜 의도가 없었느니. 하지만 인간의 피를 핥는 걸 즐기는 너 추하고 비열한 곤충만은 내가 어떤 처벌을 달게 받더라도 죽여야겠다.”

307. 올리브나무와 무화과나무 (이솝 우화)
​

THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons. A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree. But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did not injure it at all.
올리브나무가 무화과나무(사진링크 ▶ https://goo.gl/EIzuG7 )를 비웃으며 말했어요.
“난 사계절 푸르른데, 너희 무화과나무들은 계절마다 이파리 색이 변하는구나.”

AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in company with a Kite. “Why,” said the Kite, “do I see you with such a rueful look?’ “I seek,” she replied, “a mate suitable for me, and am not able to find one.” “Take me,” returned the Kite, “I am much stronger than you are.” “Why, are you able to secure the means of living by your plunder?’ “Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons.” The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate.
상심에 겨워하고 있는 독수리(여자)가 나뭇가지 위에 자신의 친구인 솔개(남자)와 앉아 있었어요.
“왜,”라며 솔개가 말했어요. “그리 울상이니?”
“응,”라며 독수리가 대답했어요. “나와 함께 살 배우자를 찾고 있는데 여간 힘든 게 아니네.”
“나 어때,”라며 솔개가 답했어요. “난 너보다 힘도 훨씬 세잖니.”
“너 나 먹여 살릴 수 있어?”
“그럼, 난 이따금씩 이 발톱으로 타조도 잡아오는 걸.”
이 말에 설득된 독수리는 자신의 배우자로 솔개를 선택했답니다.
​

Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, “Fly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised me.” The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length of time it had lain about the fields. “Is this,” said the Eagle, “the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?’ The Kite replied, “That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the performance.”
결혼식을 올린 후 바로, 독수리(여자)가 말했어요.

“이게,”라며 독수리가 말했어요. “내 결혼승낙에 대한 네 충실한 답변이니?”

이에 개구리들이 목청을 높이며 항의를 했는데 이 소리가 하늘까지 가 닿았어요.
개구리들이 개굴개굴 불평하는 소리에 시달리던 제우스신이 “대체 왜들 그러는 게냐?”라고 묻기에 이르렀답니다.
개구리들 중 한 명이 말했지요.
“독신인 태양이 지금도 늪들을 바싹 말리는 바람에 바짝 마른 집에서 저희 개구리들이 비참하게 죽어 가고 있는데. 이제 결혼까지 해 태양을 하나 더 낳게 되면 저흰 진짜 어쩌라고요?”
